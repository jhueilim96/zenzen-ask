# Zenzren Ask DE Project üöÄ

Welcome to the Zenzren Ask DE (Data Engineering) project! This project is meticulously crafted to spotlight advanced data engineering proficiencies, particularly in sculpting **robust data pipelines** that harmonize structured and unstructured data. A highlight of our endeavor is the meticulous creation of a _knowledge graph_ and a _search engine_ as integral pipelines. These components transcend mere data processing; they breathe life into unstructured data, infusing it with semantic richness and facilitating profound insights. Below, immerse yourself in an elaborate overview of the project's components and the innovative technologies underpinning them.

## Overview

Zenzren Ask DE is a data engineering project aimed at building efficient data pipelines for extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) anime data. The project encompasses several key components:

- **API Extraction**: Fetching anime data from APIs.
- **Data Orchestration**: Utilizing Dagster as the orchestration tool for managing pipelines.
- **OLAP Database**: Employing DuckDB as the OLAP database to simulate a data warehouse.
- **Transformation Framework**: Utilizing DBT for data transformation, leveraging SQL best practices.
- **Knowledge Graph**: Extending the project to include the creation of a _knowledge graph_ using Neo4j as the graph database, facilitating insightful relationships within the data.
- **Typesense Search Engine**: Implementing a pipeline to integrate with the _Typesense search engine_, enhancing data accessibility and search functionality within the project.

## Technologies Used

- **Dagster**: Dagster is utilized for orchestrating complex data pipelines, providing a unified view of the entire process.
- **DuckDB**: DuckDB serves as the OLAP database, offering efficient querying and analytics capabilities suitable for smaller data volumes.
- **DBT (Data Build Tool)**: DBT is employed as the transformation framework, enabling seamless data transformations using SQL with built-in best practices.
- **Neo4j**: Neo4j is used for building and querying the knowledge graph, facilitating relationships and insights within the data.
- **Typesense**: Typesense is integrated as the search engine, enhancing data accessibility and search functionality within the project.
