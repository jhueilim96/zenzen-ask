She is a British girl raised in an orphanage, and is a relative newcomer to Japan. She is frequently seen together with Yakumo, as they are classmates and members of the Tea Club. With her cheerful and positive attitude, she does her best to support Yakumo, particularly on the latter&#039;s relationship with Kenji Harima and her difficulties with the unwanted attentions of Haruki Hanai. She stayed over with Yakumo to accompany her while Tenma was away for the Kyoto trip.    Sarah has several part-time jobs outside school. She is a nun at a local church, performing duties such as hearing confessions, playing the organ, and babysitting children. Although her position as a nun may preclude her from pursuing romantic relationships, she reveals in a conversation with Akira Takano that she may have an eye on someone; furthermore, at least one hopeful student has expressed interest in her. Aside from her duties as a nun, Sarah also works with Hiroyoshi As\u014d of 2-C at a Chinese restaurant, waiting tables and cooking.

His past:    Dietrich was born in a province in Germanicus, the son of a landowner. At very young age, he was able to display his unusual intelligence, to the point that it scared the people of his town. He was not treated as a genius, but rather as a monster.    When Dietrich was six, his father tried to kill him because he grew scared of the little boy&#039;s apparent potential for evilness. He was unsuccessful, however as Dietrich was able to kill his entire family at the age of 6.    He used his father&#039;s lands to collect people from his own town and use them as his toys. He experimented on them and killed them.    When Dietrich was 7, Cain and Isaak visited his town by coincidence. When Dietrich saw Cain, Dietrich was amazed at the tremendous power that Cain possesses. This was the first time in his life that he found someone who is far more powerful than he is. Cain is a being that has surpassed good and evil, hence he became an element of pure destruction. At this time, Cain and Isaak already seized control of the ROSENCREUZ. Dietrich joined the Orden and at the age of 10, he was already in a high ranking position.    Perhaps the encounter with Cain and Isaak had given the boy a purpose for his life, as he was rather aimless at the beginning. Dietrich is innocent, but evil. That is why he makes a formidable enemy of Abel and Esther.    To him, trust, love, friendship and loyalty do not exist, and he therefore goes on without these, alone. He sees people as his toys. He is intrigued by Esther and Abel because they are complete opposites of him.

He used to study at London University under the name of Isaac Butler, and was involved in the incident which killed William&#039;s fianc&eacute; and led to both to them being expelled. Since he met Cain, Isaak takes care of Cain&#039;s regeneration and leads the Orden with him, though his true motivation for doing so is unknown. He enjoys smoking cigarillos and quoting works of literature. Issak does not usually appear in public, preferring to let others carry out his plans. When he does move to the front lines, he shows excellent battle prowess and is not easily defeated.     Isaak possesses many talents and is well versed in the use of Lost Technologies. His primary weapon is an attack called the Arrow of Belial, a massive sphere of light that shoots a multitude of energy bolts at his opponent. He also possesses the ability to project a nearly impenatrable electromagnetic wall, known as the Shield of Asmoday, around his body. This defense can be utilized at will and is capable of blocking almost any assault. In addition, Isaak created artificial demons that he can summon into battle to aid him. He has two kinds of demons: dwarfs called the &quot;Schatten Kobolds&quot; that appear to be little devils concealing their forms in K&auml;mpfer&#039;s shadow, and knomes, monstrous worm-like creatures with the ability to tunnel through the ground at amazing speeds. The latter only appear in the novels. His hair, which is made of thin mono-carbon fibers, is strong enough to cut through the hardest diamond making it another formidable weapon.    According to the novels, Dietrich von Lohengrin is Isaak&#039;s protege and it is probably under his tutelage that Dietrich gained the knowledge to create the Death Hunters.

Her real name is Seth Nightroad. She is the youngest of the Nightroad siblings, and the third Crusnik. A member of the Alliance Aerospace Navy, Seth viewed Lilith as a mother figure and holds Abel in great sisterly affection. When Cain was fatally wounded in an accident, she injected him with 100% Crusnik, restoring his life, but changing him for the worse. After he killed Lilith during the war, Seth joined Abel in confronting him and together they succeeded in launching him out of an airlock.    Among the four Crusnik siblings, she has spent the most time with Methuselah, but like Abel, she does not feed on them. Around 800 years ago, Augusta Vradica led the Methuselah to the lands where the Empire would eventually stand, to save them from persecution. She helped restore nature back to the lands, returning them to their former glory before the Armageddon. She then became the Empress of the New Human Empire, ruling over her kingdom as the heart of the Empire itself. As the Empress, Seth is seen as a mother by her people, and treats her subjects as she would her own children. However, most of her courtiers and servants have never seen her before in all the centuries that they have served her, mainly due to the heavy veils she wears to cover her appearance as well as the use of a voice modifier. Though she does age, she still appears as a little girl, but is well over nine hundred years old. It is implied that she does not wish to declare war on the Vatican territories due to her brother's support of the humans. As his sister, she knows Abel very well, and has commented that he is quite popular with the girls for some unknown reason.    During a plot to overthrow her, Seth disguised herself as a tea-seller and a medical student in the human district of the capital city, Byzantium. During that time, she met Ion Fortuna and Sister Esther Blanchett, though neither knew who she was. She later alerted Abel and Asthe when Ion and Esther were in danger, and saved Esther from one of Dietrich's puppets.    When her Crusnik powers are activated, Seth's eyes turn red, her lips turn greenish-blue, her voice becomes deeper, wings styled like fairy-like prop from her back and a pair of giant tuning forks made of blood materialize in each of her hands. In this state, she can almost instantly disintegrate her enemies. Similar to Cain, her power appears be based on a manipulation of sound waves.

He was once the gentle, beloved leader of the Mars Colonization Project, until an accident killed him. Seth injected him with the Crusnik nanomachines which saved his life, but also drove him insane. In the war following the return of the colonialists to Earth, he and Abel took the side of the vampire returners. When Lilith's influence made Abel question their choice, Cain killed her. Furious, Abel and Seth confronted their brother, pushing Cain out of the space ship and into the atmosphere. His body burned into a pile of ash. Cain was able to regenerate his body from the ash, however, he sometimes has difficulty holding his makeshift body together.    Nine hundred years later, he met Isaak Fernand von K&auml;mpfer. Together, they took over the Rosenkreuz Orden, a small, insignificant organization in Berlin that consisted of enemies of the Vatican. Through Cain and Isaak's charisma and power, the Orden grew into the world's leading terrorist organization. Cain's motivations are unclear, but he seems bent on the destroying humanity and the world. His subjects refer to him as &quot;Mein Herr&quot; which is German for &quot;My Lord.&quot; He is also referred to as &quot;Mein Herr Contra Mundi&quot;, German for &quot;My Lord Against the World&quot;. His most popular title, however, appears to be Contra Mundi.    Once his brother Abel learns Cain is alive, Abel's primary goal becomes to kill Cain once and for all. When Cain leads the Rosenkreuz Orden on an attack of Albion, the two brothers have their first clash and Cain kills Abel with relative ease due to his higher Crusnik fusion level and Esther's sudden appearance, that distracted Abel. Realizing Abel had destroyed the control panels of the rocket, he plans to merge himself with Abel's body to get the access codes from Abel's memory. However, Abel is revived with Lilith's nanomachines thanks to Caterina and Tres. This puts Abel at the same power level as Cain and their next clash ends in a draw. Accompanied by Ion Fortuna, Abel has pledged to hunt Cain for eternity, if need be, until he is destroyed.    When his Crusnik powers are activated, Cain's lips and eyes turn red, his hands grow blue claws, he grows four white wings, and a black lance materializes in his hands. In this state, he can generate destructive red energy. When not in Crusnik form, he appears to have the power to launch a destructive and invisible force from his hands and to possess super strength. Among the four Crusniks, Cain is the only one who has fused 100% with his nanomachines in the novels, however in the anime Abel also achieves 100% fusion, without the insanity, after being infused with Lilith's nanomachines.

The most powerful close-combat weapon found amongst the Lost Technology relics, the sword uses ionized xenon gas to create a high-density, high-temperature plasma blade capable of cutting through anything.    Asthe's view of humans begins to change after she is sent to Venice to arrest Endre Kourza, a vampire mass murderer whose newest round of killings in Vatican territory could spur a war. As part of her mission, she is partnered with Father Abel Nightroad from the AX Agency. When the two find Endre, Asthe becomes solely focused on killing him because he murdered her partner. She is so blinded by her rage that she destroys the Rialto Bridge, killing and wounding many humans that had come for a festival. Abel also sustains injuries while protecting her from her own sword, which flew back at her in the explosion. She greatly regrets her actions, and keeps a better handle on her emotions when they go after Endre again and arrest him. Though she initially berated Abel for calling himself her partner, a word of special meaning to Asthe, at the end of the mission, he earned her respect enough for her to call him her partner.

Nearly a millennium in age, Abel was created in 2088 A.D. as one of four test tube babies whose bodies were infused with Crusnik nanomachines by the Mars human colonists. Abel once had a hatred for humanity and joined the Methuselah in the war against humans after the Armageddon. During the war between the humans and Methuselah, Abel Nightroad killed seven million humans. Lilith&#039;s death during the war caused him to abandon his hatred. He spent 900 years weeping and mourning in Lilith&#039;s crypt at the Vatican, until a young Caterina Sforza fled there to escape Methuselah assassins.

In penance for his earlier sins, Abel now adheres to a strict principle of pacifism and has taken a vow not to kill unless he absolutely must. Though accepting of his Crusnik form, he will generally only use it as a last resort. After meeting Esther, he is reluctant to use his Crusnik form in a battle for fear of her seeing it, and after she does see it for the first time, Abel is extremely distraught and screams in agony. Later he tells her it is the mark of his sins. Notably, in regards to Esther, in the novels and manga, Abel first reveals his Crusnik form during the Star of Sorrow arc, not long after he meets her, and, in the manga, part of her reasons for joining AX is to find out more about Abel (also in the novels, he is nowhere near as distraught for showing her as in the anime). He seems to be oblivious to Esther&#039;s romantic feelings for him, and possibly to his own feelings for her. Asthe seems to have noticed, though, and calls him a dunce for not being bothered by Ion&#039;s affections for Esther. While he mostly responds to her with fatherly affection, when he thought she had been killed, he lost control of himself and went into Crusnik form, seeming to delight in killing the Methuselah Radu who he thought had killed Esther. It is Esther that helps him return to normal.    Abel eventually learns that Lilith&#039;s killer and his brother, Cain, is still alive and swears to find and kill him, once and for all. After Abel finds and confronts him, Cain defeats Abel and sends him into a near death state. While Esther mourns at Abel&#039;s grave, Cardinal Caterina retrieves the nanomachines from Lilith&#039;s body and sends Father Tres to take them to Abel in order to revive him. Tres delivers them to Abel&#039;s grave, both reviving him and allowing him to achieve 100% Crusnik fusion without the insanity that manifested in Cain. Immediately afterwards, Cain arrives and Abel battles him again, but the fight ends in a draw and Abel must continue his quest to destroy his brother, now joined by Ion Fortuna    In his human form, Abel fights with a gun loaded with silver bullets. With 40% of his Crusnik nanomachines activated, his eyes become red, his lips turn dark blue, his teeth become fangs, and a gigantic red scythe composed of crystallized blood materializes in his hands. At 80% activation, his nails turn into claws, grows black wings and he can generate massive amounts of electricity. He can only achieve this form, or higher, if he has fed on a vampire, otherwise there is a risk the nanomachines will refuse the command and cause him to collapse. At 100% activation, he turns into a humanoid creature with dark skin, black bat-like wings, and blue markings that cover his entire body. He also generates more electricity than his 80% form and a second blade forms on the other end of his blood scythe. While in Crusnik form, the blood of Methuselah is drawn to him and goes directly into his body without using his fangs.!~  (Source: Wikipedia)"}}, {"role": "SUPPORTING", "voiceActors": [{"id": 95184, "name": {"first": "Hitomi", "last": "Nabatame"}}, {"id": 95510, "name": {"first": "Gwendolyn", "last": "Lau"}}, {"id": 101135, "name": {"first": "Marieke", "last": "Oeffinger"}}, {"id": 102839, "name": {"first": "Bea", "last": "Vad\u00e1sz"}}, {"id": 109769, "name": {"first": "Min-Jeong", "last": "Yeo"}}, {"id": 153446, "name": {"first": "Kate", "last": "Kelly"}}, {"id": 116811, "name": {"first": "Alessandra", "last": "Karpoff"}}], "node": {"id": 2198, "name": {"first": "Kate", "middle": null, "last": "Scott", "full": "Kate Scott", "native": null, "alternative": ["Iron Maiden"]}, "description": "Sister Kate manifests as a hologram.

His original name was Shinta (\u5fc3\u592a). \n\nHis parents died of cholera when he was very young and as a result, was adopted by three slave women in a traveling slave wagon. Soon after meeting them, bandits had raided the convoy and killed his three new guardians and where about to kill him when Seijuro Hiko killed the bandits. Hiko soon adopted the child and because Shinta was not a name fitted for a swordman, he renamed him Kenshin, meaning \"Heart of Sword,\" took him under his wing and taught him the Hiten Mitsuruugi Ryu.   \n\n~! However, before full completion of the sword style could be passed on to Kenshin, the Japanese Revolution had been happening at the time and right before Kenshin's eyes.  Because of his kind nature and seeing people suffering, he knew he needed to do something about it.  He left in the middle of his training and without his master's blessing and joined the Imperialists.  It was during the Revolution where Kenshin met Tomoe, his first love and wife. During the revolution, Kenshin was given the nickname of Hitokiri Battousai because of his god-like speed of drawing a sword to kill the enemy instantly. After helping the Imperialist to a position where they would undoubtedly win the revolution, Kenshin left the revolution all-together with a vow to never kill again and the reverse-blade sword handed to him by Shakku-dono. It was Tomoe's death by his hands that pushed him over the edge of never to kill again.!~\n\nThe next time we see Kenshin is 10 years later as he has become a wanderer who helps out anyone in need who is suffering right before his eyes. Those long 10 years have taken him from Kyoto, all over Japan to where we find him in episode one of the anime, in Tokyo, still keeping his vow never to kill again. It is here where he meets Kaoru Kamiya and his whole life begins to change once again.\n\nKenshin is usually depicted as a care-free swordsman who is very aloof and tends to be a bit simple-minded when it comes to living normally. He is seen to be doing many of the chores around the dojo that he stays at with Kaoru, (i.e., cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc.). He believes it is his way of repaying Kaoru with allowing him to stay at her dojo. (although it seems he has gotten attracted to kaoru in the end). However, his swordsmanship ranks among the elite as he is seen defeating every rival (with the exception of Hajime Saitou which ended in a draw). His battle senses are top-notch and he recognizes even the slightest of advantages, strategies and tactics during a sword battle.    \n\n(Source: kenshin.wikia.com)"}}, {"role": "SUPPORTING", "voiceActors": [{"id": 95113, "name": {"first": "Rikiya", "last": "Koyama"}}, {"id": 143685, "name": {"first": "Andi", "last": "Kr\u00f6sing"}}], "node": {"id": 21577, "name": {"first": "Toshizo", "middle": null, "last": "Hijikata", "full": "Toshizo Hijikata", "native": "\u571f\u65b9\u6b73\u4e09", "alternative": []}, "description": "Toshizo Hijikata is the &quot;demon&quot; Vice-Commander of the Shinsengumi.      ~!Hijikata makes two brief appearances in the Tsuiokuhen OVA:  First, immediately after the interrogation of Furutaka Shuntaro (Masuya) and during a meeting at Shinsengumi Headquarters, just right before the Shinsengumi's raid at Ikedaya.!~"}}, {"role": "SUPPORTING", "voiceActors": [{"id": 95133, "name": {"first": "Wataru", "last": "Takagi"}}, {"id": 96328, "name": {"first": "Jason", "last": "Phelps"}}, {"id": 156432, "name": {"first": "Oliver", "last": "Betke"}}, {"id": 165081, "name": {"first": "Claudio", "last": "Beccari"}}], "node": {"id": 79447, "name": {"first": "Shinsaku", "middle": null, "last": "Takasugi", "full": "Shinsaku Takasugi", "native": "\u9ad8\u6749\u664b\u4f5c", "alternative": []}, "description": "Takasugi originated the revolutionary idea of auxiliary irregular militia (shotai). Under the feudal system, only the samurai class was allowed to own weapons. Takasugi promoted the recruitment of commoners into new, socially-mixed paramilitary units. In these units, neither recruitment nor promotion depended (at least in theory), on social status. Farmers, merchants, carpenters and even sumo-wrestlers and Buddhist priests were enlisted, although samurai still formed the majority in most of the Shotai. Takasugi clearly saw that utilization of the financial wealth of the middle-class merchants and farmers could increase the military strength of the domain, without weakening its finances. Since the leaders of Ch\u014dsh\u016b were unable - and unwilling - to change the social structure of the domain, limited use of peasants and commoners enabled them to form a new type of military without disturbing the traditional society.  In 1863, Takasugi himself founded a special Shotai unit under his direct command called the Kiheitai, which consisted of 300 soldiers (about half of whom were samurai). Weakened by the punitive attack by the Western powers, Ch\u014dsh\u016b was unable to withstand an expedition mounted by the Bakufu in autumn 1864 in retaliation for previous Ch\u014dsh\u016b attempts to seize control of Kyoto. At first, conservative forces, which favored conciliation with the Bakufu in order to secure the domain, were dominant in Ch\u014dsh\u016b politics, and Takasugi and some of his compatriots had to leave the domain to avoid renewed imprisonment. Takasugi, with only about a dozen followers, including future political leaders Yamagata Aritomo, It\u014d Hirobumi and Inoue Kaoru, gathered in Kokura in Ky\u016bsh\u016b and prepared an attack on the conservative forces in Ch\u014dsh\u016b. The subsequent Ch\u014dsh\u016b civil war began on 13 January 1865.  Takasugi played a major role in this civil war and his Kiheitai militia proved its superiority over old-fashioned samurai forces. With a series of quick strikes and the support of Kido Takayoshi, Takasugi achieved victory by March 1865. He became one of the main arbiters of the Ch\u014dsh\u016b domain's policy and continued to act as the domain's expert on Western military science, devoting his efforts to importing arms and raising troops. These reforms proved to be successful when Ch\u014dsh\u016b was victorious on four fronts against the Bakufu's Second Ch\u014dsh\u016b expedition in 1866, with the Kiheitai itself securing victory on two fronts. Takasugi\u2019s efforts had made a small-scale \u2018nation in arms\u2019 out of Ch\u014dsh\u016b, giving it a military strength out of proportion to its relatively small size. With its victory over the Tokugawa forces, the military power of the Bakufu was discredited, and traditionally rival domains decided to join forces with Ch\u014dsh\u016b in the subsequent battles which led to the Meiji Restoration and the end of the Tokugawa Bakufu."}}, {"role": "SUPPORTING", "voiceActors": [{"id": 95286, "name": {"first": "Nozomu", "last": "Sasaki"}}, {"id": 101499, "name": {"first": "Yeong-seon", "last": "Kim"}}, {"id": 105706, "name": {"first": "Dirk", "last": "Petrick"}}, {"id": 96286, "name": {"first": "Massimo", "last": "Di Benedetto"}}], "node": {"id": 5710, "name": {"first": "Enishi", "middle": null, "last": "Yukishiro", "full": "Enishi Yukishiro", "native": "\u96ea\u4ee3\u7e01", "alternative": ["Mr. Black Shades"]}, "description": "When Enishi was an infant, his mother died and he was raised by his older sister, Tomoe.

Kiyosato later joined the Mimawarigumi believing that the sombre Tomoe would be happy if he became a hero, only to be killed by Hitokiri Batt\u014dsai (Himura Kenshin) for the new era.

He became angry and disappointed with Kenshin, because he ran away to join the rebellion against the Tokugawa regime. He shut himself away from the rest of the world; he lives as a potter close to the forest near Kyoto. In Seisouhen/Reflection, he also realizes that the Hiten Mitsurugi-Ryu no longer seems relevant in the changing world, as he remarks to Yahiko: \"The only thing that doesn't seem to change is the moon.\"  Hiko is perhaps the strongest swordsman around; he is way too superior even to Kenshin.

After fifteen years, master and student meet once more. It is then that Kenshin will complete his training, if Kenshin can survive Hiko's ego.  The cloak is not only distinctive for all Hiten Mitsurugi masters, but it also serves to strengthen them in peacetime. Even when conflict is not at the door, Hiko remains in training just by wearing it, as it is composed of several heavy materials that weigh him down and force him to work out because of counter-springs with pressure of around 37.5 kilograms. Watsuki mentions in the manga that he based the billowy capes' image on Spawn of Image Comics by Todd McFarlane (the size of the collar pieces was reduced in the anime).

Shigure has burdened himself with Gentatsu&#039;s death and tries to make amends by housing and taking care of Gentatsu&#039;s younger sister Toki.

He befriends Kenshin Himura after hastily dealing with some foreign sailors who were harassing Toki. Kenshin is warned by Hajime Saito about Shigure&#039;s dealings and activities. Kenshin brushes the warning off until he encounters Shigure in the midst of an assault on the British embassy. They fight then Shigure recognizes the swordplay kenshin uses and realizes Kenshin murdered Gentatsu, which enrages him to become more intense. The battle is cut short as Shigure retreats due to his army being overwhelmed.    Kenshin follows to a nearby fort where the Aizu remnant have barricaded themselves. With help from Sanosuke Sagara, Kenshin confronts Shigure one last time. After a while a teary eyed Toki runs in to embrace him telling him he&#039;s had enough fighting. Shigure succumbs to his emotions and breaks down saying that Kenshin had honoured Gentasu&#039;s death more than him.

He would return home years later to discover that his mother was dead, having died a couple of years after the birth of his younger brother, Ota, who immediately began to admire Sanosuke for his bravery and boldness. Sanosuke would also find out that his family name was now Higashidani, although he would never use it himself. His sister, after Sanosuke's disappearance and then her mother's death, became overprotective of her younger brother and father, who worked as a local merchant and farmer with the infamy of being a local fighter. Ota, after Sanosuke leaves his family again, would eventually follow his brother's advice and train at the Kamiya Kasshin-Ry\u016b style dojo to become strong. The Sekihoutai fought for the imperial alliance at the end of the Tokugawa regime and Sanosuke admired his captain, Sagara S\u014dz\u014d and took the family name Sagara from him. The Sekih\u014d Army were on assignment to spread word of the halving of taxes proclaimed by the revolution. However, when the revolutionary government encountered financial problems, they labeled the Sekihoutai as frauds to bury their promises. This setup was engineered by Shind\u014d Tatewaki, a former officer in the imperial alliance. The Sekihoutai were designated scapegoats and to be executed; Sanosuke was the only survivor, other than his friend Tsukioka Katsuhiro. The exact circumstances of S\u014dz\u014d's death differ between the animated version and the manga; in the manga Sanosuke realized he had been killed after seeing his decapitated head on display as a warning, while in the anime a wounded S\u014dz\u014d pushed Sanosuke to safety off a cliff in order to save him before dying himself. Full of anger and bitterness, Sanosuke made a living as a fighter-for-hire who bore the nickname \"Zanza\" derived from his weapon, the zanbat\u014d. Sanosuke's sword, the heaviest katana ever made in the Rurouni Kenshin universe, originates from the \u014cnin Struggle. Due to wear the blade no longer has an edge. Sanosuke uses the sword to smash and crush. Hiruma Kihei and Gohei hire Sanosuke to kill Himura Kenshin, but after the former assassin defeats Sanosuke and Sanosuke learns of the truth of Kenshin's no-kill approach, Sanosuke becomes a valuable ally. He later adopts a boxing-like fighting skill, known for the strength of his right fist. Because the zanbat\u014d broke during the fight, Sanosuke no longer wields it on a regular basis, using only one more time in the manga to defend the Kamiya dojo during the Jinchu arc. At the end of the manga series, Sanosuke leaves Japan to avoid becoming wrongfully arrested and travels the world. He is not heard from until five years later during a reunion of the Kenshin-gumi, in which he tells them via a letter that he is in Mongolia and will stay there for a while before heading back to Japan. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"}}, {"role": "MAIN", "voiceActors": [{"id": 95108, "name": {"first": "Mayo", "last": "Suzukaze"}}, {"id": 96112, "name": {"first": "J.

His original name was Shinta (\u5fc3\u592a). \n\nHis parents died of cholera when he was very young and as a result, was adopted by three slave women in a traveling slave wagon. Soon after meeting them, bandits had raided the convoy and killed his three new guardians and where about to kill him when Seijuro Hiko killed the bandits. Hiko soon adopted the child and because Shinta was not a name fitted for a swordman, he renamed him Kenshin, meaning \"Heart of Sword,\" took him under his wing and taught him the Hiten Mitsuruugi Ryu.   \n\n~! However, before full completion of the sword style could be passed on to Kenshin, the Japanese Revolution had been happening at the time and right before Kenshin's eyes.  Because of his kind nature and seeing people suffering, he knew he needed to do something about it.  He left in the middle of his training and without his master's blessing and joined the Imperialists.  It was during the Revolution where Kenshin met Tomoe, his first love and wife. During the revolution, Kenshin was given the nickname of Hitokiri Battousai because of his god-like speed of drawing a sword to kill the enemy instantly. After helping the Imperialist to a position where they would undoubtedly win the revolution, Kenshin left the revolution all-together with a vow to never kill again and the reverse-blade sword handed to him by Shakku-dono. It was Tomoe's death by his hands that pushed him over the edge of never to kill again.!~\n\nThe next time we see Kenshin is 10 years later as he has become a wanderer who helps out anyone in need who is suffering right before his eyes. Those long 10 years have taken him from Kyoto, all over Japan to where we find him in episode one of the anime, in Tokyo, still keeping his vow never to kill again. It is here where he meets Kaoru Kamiya and his whole life begins to change once again.\n\nKenshin is usually depicted as a care-free swordsman who is very aloof and tends to be a bit simple-minded when it comes to living normally. He is seen to be doing many of the chores around the dojo that he stays at with Kaoru, (i.e., cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc.). He believes it is his way of repaying Kaoru with allowing him to stay at her dojo. (although it seems he has gotten attracted to kaoru in the end). However, his swordsmanship ranks among the elite as he is seen defeating every rival (with the exception of Hajime Saitou which ended in a draw). His battle senses are top-notch and he recognizes even the slightest of advantages, strategies and tactics during a sword battle.    \n\n(Source: kenshin.wikia.com)"}}, {"role": "SUPPORTING", "voiceActors": [{"id": 95286, "name": {"first": "Nozomu", "last": "Sasaki"}}, {"id": 109825, "name": {"first": "Gwang ju", "last": "Jeon"}}, {"id": 153695, "name": {"first": "Peter", "last": "Lontzek"}}, {"id": 96423, "name": {"first": "Marcelo", "last": "Campos"}}, {"id": 230427, "name": {"first": "Maurizio", "last": "Fiorentini"}}], "node": {"id": 21348, "name": {"first": "Gentatsu", "middle": null, "last": "Takatsuki", "full": "Gentatsu Takatsuki", "native": "\u9ad8\u69fb\u53b3\u9054", "alternative": []}, "description": "Gentatsu Takatsuki  was a hitokiri for the Aizu Clan and a master of the Kanuma Ryu sword style.

Harald immediately falls in love with her, but Emma is only interested in his programming talents. One day Emma calls Harald and asks him to meet her. She never makes it, crashing her car and dying at the age of 28. Harald, unaware of the accident, waits for her under a gingko tree.   ~!Harald, grief stricken over his love's death, decides to create a tangible expression of his love for Emma. Harald decided to create a virtual daughter, named Aura, who would become the ultimate AI by receiving data on humanity and it's various emotions. To do this, Harald created Morganna Mode Gone, an omniscient AI program designed to collect information and then be Data Drained by Aura, in order to complete her as the Ultimate AI.  In 2006, Harald brings a game called Fragment to the company CC Corp, the vessel for Aura's birth disguised as an MMORPG. However, things do not go as planned. Morganna deletes the maternal part of her program out of fear, and becomes unstable.  Aura, meanwhile, has been sleeping, waiting for Morganna to wake her up. For 2 years Morganna does not awaken Aura. Realizing that things aren't going as planned, Harald leaves his physical body behind to talk to Morganna. Here is a quote by Harald right before his transformation:  AI Harald in .hack//Sign\"I must...speak with Morganna. To go where she is, the living flesh poses a hindrance. But I must. I must go. For our Aura. Emma, please give me a little more courage.\"  Despite his efforts, Harald becomes trapped in the game world by Morganna and restricted to various niches in The World. It is there he stays, trapped in a looped dialogue expressing his regrets and the error he made in creating Morganna. It is this form that BT, Bear, Tsukasa and the rest of the .hack//Sign party find, (dubbed by them as \"The Broken Man.\") However, he is unintelligelible, repeating the same dialogue over and over again. Tsukasa recognizes \"The Girl\" he is talking about is Aura, but is data drained by Morganna before he can tell the rest of the party. Later, the party finds a more functioning version of Harald, where he warns the party about Morganna and begs the players to protect Aura, saying \"I will gladly receive any punishment...but Aura does not deserve this.\" Morganna, enraged by Harald's meddling, deletes him, which is seemingly the last of the genius programmer.  However, Harald is not dead. In .hack//Quarantine, Kite and BlackRose of the .hackers meet Harald, although now he is a giant tablet of stone. He is, again, largely unintelligible, but he does impart one phrase that strikes Kite: \"It is darkest...before...the Dawn.\" Kite thinks this means that Harald meant for Aura to become complete, not for Morganna to win and for the coma victims to be lost. Harald is then destroyed by Cubia. Whether this is the last of Harald in The World is unclear; his resilience thus far hints at another possible return. An AI found by Taihaku and Haseo in the Painful Forest event could possibly be Harald somehow still alive within The World R:2, though the area he was in was deleted shortly after Haseo met him. !~ (Source: Wikipedia) "}}, {"role": "SUPPORTING", "voiceActors": [{"id": 95349, "name": {"first": "Dave", "last": "Wittenberg"}}, {"id": 95477, "name": {"first": "Hiroshi", "last": "Yanaka"}}, {"id": 100140, "name": {"first": "S\u00e9rgio", "last": "Corcetti"}}, {"id": 104237, "name": {"first": "Yann", "last": "Pichon"}}, {"id": 104238, "name": {"first": "Rolman", "last": "Bastidas"}}, {"id": 104239, "name": {"first": "Francesco", "last": "Meoni"}}, {"id": 104240, "name": {"first": "Walter", "last": "von Hauff"}}, {"id": 110097, "name": {"first": "In-Seong", "last": "Oh"}}], "node": {"id": 2183, "name": {"first": "Sora", "middle": null, "last": null, "full": "Sora", "native": "\u695a\u826f", "alternative": ["Ryou Misaki"]}, "description": "Sora is a Twin Blade player killer who enjoys hunting players down, especially attractive female ones, and demanding their Member Addresses in exchange for their lives.

To date, Lind is the only Goddess who can support twin Angels. This marks her as somewhat unique in heaven as a Goddess of incredible inner strength. However, her vigorous training had buried her true personality beneath an almost impenetrable network of shields and walls. Because she worked so hard training her combat skills, her non-combat magic has been neglected and, as a result, is imprecise - the results of her restoration spells have been confused with enemy attacks.     After the Angel Eater incident, she smiled for the first time in a long while, resulting in a small sliver of her true personality to shine through the walls of her long-running, seemingly indifferent, business-like demeanor.     In the television series, she does not demonstrate this emotional introversion. Although she is still focused on her duty, she does show a higher degree of emotion.    In the manga, Lind is the fifth first class goddess to be introduced, while in the anime she is the fourth.

However, this does not mean that she is to be taken lightly; Belldandy is licensed as a goddess first-class, unlimited, and as such is highly skilled. Her power is so great, in fact, that she is required to wear a special earring on her left ear which constantly seals the full brunt of her magical strength. The only time at which she has ever revealed her true strength is during the Lord of Terror arc. At the end of this arc, Belldandy completely reconstructed their home from rubble, mentioning that doing so only took one ten-millionth of her power.\n\nBelldandy's capacities and talents are diverse, whether magical or worldly. Not only can she change the appearance of her clothing and levitate (and, by extension, fly) as all full-fledged goddesses are expected to, but she can also teleport through mirrors, speak to and understand animals, \"see\" people's emotions as auras, heal minor wounds by speeding metabolism, and \"speak\" to machines. Furthermore, she is a superb cook, and her singing skills are held to be the best in the heavens. She is also incapable of getting drunk on alcoholic drinks, but instead gets drunk with soda (it has to be noted, however, that she's a complete lightweight in this regard. One sip is enough to send her in a drunken rampage\u2014although given her personality, \"rampage\" takes an entirely different, but no less destructive, meaning). In addition, she is also the top broom racer in heaven, the only one that could rival her is Welsper from hell or Hild the Daimakaichou herself.\n\nBelldandy's angel is Holy Bell (Bless\u9920Bell in some versions of the English manga); her elemental attribute is wind. Like all angels, Holy Bell augments Belldandy's magical powers when called upon, and like all angels, she also reflects her master's current state. For example, when Belldandy falls unconscious after being infected with a virus (in the movie), Holy Bell emerges comatose and covered with crystals that represent the virus.\n\nBelldandy does not appear to play a significant role in maintaining Yggdrasil.

She attends the Nekomi Institute of Technology (NIT), like Keiichi, as an engineering student. Megumi is also a very skilled mechanic and even went against Skuld in a robot construction contest (the result was a draw). In the manga, she is shown to be a very skilled motorcycle driver, although she claims that Keiichi and Belldandy are better than she is. It is hinted in the OVA that she joins the Motor Club, but in the manga, the movie, and the TV series, she is actually a member of the softball club. In the manga, she also becomes the \"queen\" (a title she seemingly hates, but lives up to anyway) of the bike racers in the local touge after she consistently beats the previous queen while on her way to school. In the movie, Keiichi also refers to her as \"The Queen of Drag Racing.\" Recently in the Manga she has reappeared at the temple drunk, only to drop crying into Keiichi after being dumped for the third time, after her former boyfriends could not keep up with pressure of dating a local celebrity. This echoes when Sayoko Mishima appeared drunk near the temple after being abandoned by everyone in favor of Belldandy, then falling into Keiichi's arms and confessing her problems.   Generally, Megumi acts like a teenager, albeit with a mature attitude about things. However, she can still descend into a far more childish temperament of silly remarks and competition. Her primary concern seems to be advancing in life, although she isn't obsessive about it. This manifests more as a desire to work, and she apparently holds a number of club positions at her college. Belldandy has remarked that she sees a similarity between Megumi and Skuld and that she would like to see Skuld learn some things from Megumi. She also seems to have trouble coping with rejection, as well as a borderline alcoholic, as currently seen when she was rejected for the third time in a row. This trait of consuming alcohol in large quantities seems to be a trait she seems to share with Sayoko Mishima.   Megumi also exhibits a certain degree of protectiveness towards Keiichi, although this tends to manifest as teasing. Finally, although she won't admit it, Megumi has a strong respect for Keiichi and Belldandy's mechanical skills. Megumi is presently unaware of the \"goddess\" status of Belldandy or her two sisters.

Urd and Mara used to be very good friends, but got separated when Urd chose to be a goddess.  Though Mara is the arch-rival of the goddesses she likes being with them. Her actual duty is to increase the market share of the demons on earth, her main duty should be signing demonic contracts with humans and her side duties includes ruining the activities of the goddesses, disrupting the efforts of the goddesses and to make them suffer. However, she normally forgets about her main duty and only goes around doing the side duties because she had decided in the very beginning of her appearance that the market share will become 100% when the goddesses are all gone from this part of the market.  Mara has two weaknesses: She can't stand good luck charms and she can't stop dancing when she hears rock music (or disco in the Dark Horse English translation).  Marrler seems more determined and mischievous than fully cruel. She felt abandoned when Urd chose to become a goddess in full, knowing that it would most likely lead to her having to end their friendship. This past situation and her duties as a demon make her have a slight case of tunnel vision in that she seems to regard ruining the lives of the goddesses a top priority. Despite this she does seem to enjoy the company of the goddesses whenever the opportunity to hang out with them presents itself.  In the TV series, Marller is revealed to suffer from insecurity and self doubt due to her inability to increase the demons' market share (due in no small part to the goddesses' presence), to the point of bringing her to tears when Urd tells her that she has no talent.  You may see Mara referred to by a number of other names, such as Marller or Marla. Marller is how Mr. Fujishima romanizes her name whenever her name is written out in roman characters, and Marla is how it sounds like when a Japanese speaker pronounces it and is also the romanization used by Geneon Animation for the Mini-Goddess series. In Buddhism Mara is also the name of a demon who tempted Gautama Buddha by trying to seduce him with the vision of beautiful women. Similarly in the series, Mara uses such tactics on Keiichi in her first appearance by using Sayoko to distract him from Belldandy. The reason most Japanese speakers prefer not to pronounce her name Mara is because the word \u9670\u830e, romanized \"mara\", is Japanese for \"penis\".

To further elaborate, it is interpreted that she lives with her father while her brother lives with his mother. Therefore, she no longer has a mother AT HOME. You will probably realize that in one of the episodes of Angelic Layer anime, another woman is with her father at home. But, you never hear Kaede say okaa-san (mother) to that woman. !~  ~!Unfortunately, in Chobits manga and anime, she dies of an illness. Minoru, who could not accept the fact that his sister died, created a persocom by the name of Yuzuki. Minoru inputs in programmings into Yuzuki that best represents his lovely sister's appearance and characteristics. Minoru states that seeing Yuzuki makes him sad and happy at the same time because he can live in a dream where his sister is still alive However, the painful reality is Yuzuki is not his sister. Later on, Minoru slowly realizes that Yuzuki could never be the replacement for his sister and that Yuzuki could not be replaced as well.

Although his body is almost completely artificial, he suffers little loss in humanity. His outer skin is elastic, capable of feeling sensation, and the temperature can be adjusted to the cyborg's preferences. He has eight eyes mounted on his head, four in his face (The large sensor in the middle is actually his nose) two at the bases of his \"rabbit ear\" sensors, and two at the tips, which allow him to safely look around corners. His brain is augmented by an auxiliary brain that acts as an information processor, and is capable of handling information in a conceptual format rather than hard numerical data. His cybernetics controller, the Hecatonchires system, is named after the same 100 handed giants from Greek mythology. It is capable of controlling dozens of limbs or other cyborg bodies independently from one another, with no additional strain on the user. In the manga, it is pointed out that a cyborg equipped with the Hecatonchires system is able to fully control an entire aircraft carrier on his own. This ability to process multiple limbs at once is seen in the film when he is seen using one rifle in his Landmate's arms, and another in the control arms.   Note: Briareos is the only known cyborg who has successfully integrated with  Hecatonchires system, all other test subjects could not handle it and died. This is shown in the latest appleseed movie.

Personality wise she is very optimistic, enjoys shopping and cooking, compassionate, caring and is somewhat of a romantic.

She is a rather naive young girl. Risa starts to develop a crush, then an obsession, with Dark upon seeing his attempt to steal an artwork broadcast over the news claiming that he is the mysterious person whom she is destined to be with.    There is an ongoing sisterly rivalry between her and Riku. Compared to her sister she seems more innocent and clumsier and can be seen as your typical &quot;girly-girl&quot; though shows the same stubbornness, tenacity, and kindness as Riku. She would much rather prefer fashion and relationships than to physical activities. In terms of physical features her hair is much longer and she has a &quot;softer voice&quot;, apart from that the two can&#039;t be distinguished (shown in episode 5 of the anime when the two switch places so Risa can get out of chopping cabbage as a form of afterschool punishment).    Risa obsessively pursues Dark, coming up with intricate schemes and plans to make him go out with her, some of which eventually work. There&#039;s no doubt that she is quite clever and very persistant. Later on, however, Dark tells her that the two of them cannot see each other anymore. Near the end of the anime, subtle signs of a relationship between Risa and Satoshi start to show. (example: he places her on a park bench and covers her body with his jacket after she fell unconscious during their struggles with Krad. She then wakes up only to find the jacket and a single white feather which fell from it. Although not knowing who the jacket and feather belongs to, she can be seen treasuring it). In the manga this is more apparent, shown through small occurrences (example: he saves her when she fell off a building, when Daisuke saves her from drowning he shows concern and touches a lock of her hair).    As the series progresses, Risa breaks out of being a naive little girl and develops into a more mature young lady."}}, {"role": "SUPPORTING", "voiceActors": [{"id": 95077, "name": {"first": "Masumi", "last": "Asano"}}], "node": {"id": 2764, "name": {"first": "Daichi", "middle": null, "last": "Niwa", "full": "Daichi Niwa", "native": "\u4e39\u7fbd\u5927\u5730", "alternative": []}, "description": "Appears in episode 13 of the anime D.N.Angel when Daisuke travels 20 years in the future to retrieve the lost black stone of Shiira.

Daisuke can transform into Dark (usually unwillingly) whenever he experiences feelings of love or intimacy. Daisuke is kind-hearted, the opposite of Dark and always trying to stop Dark from performing crazy stunts to no avail. Later in the series, Daisuke gradually falls in love with his old crush&#039;s older twin sister, Riku Harada. Even though he does not look or act it, Daisuke is very perceptive and athletic - capable of jumping from heights that a normal boy could never be capable of. To hone his skills, his family sets up daily life-threatening trials once he returns home from school. A specialty of this is his gift for lockpicking (or hacking, in the case of electronically activated locks) any kind of lock in succession.

She is a character exclusive to the anime version of D.N. Angel, a student who suddenly transferred to Daisuke's school (as shown in episode 14). All that is known at that time is that she left for America and stayed there for 2 years before coming back to Japan. First impressions of Mio is that she is a rather simple minded &quot;valley girl&quot; (or an American gaijin in the Japanese version, even going as far as to say &quot;Sorry! I can't speak Japanese!&quot; when confronted with certain demands or, in the English dub, telling Riku in Spanish that she can't speak English. ~! It is later revealed that she is actually a voodoo doll living in a temporary body and promised a real life by Satoshi Hiwatari's adoptive father, Kei. However, in order for her to attain a real life, someone must be sacrificed... in this case Daisuke. The initial reason why she occupied herself with Daisuke was to get him to wear a powerful magical charm (actually a pair of charms [one in the shape of a heart, the other in the form of a heart shaped key] and the pair must be interlocked when worn for the magic to activate) that would then seal his soul within it. However, over time she eventually fell in love with him. She wanted a real life, but not at the cost of Daisuke's. Mio then decides that she refuses to give up Daisuke's life and ventured to retrieve the magical charms from Riku (whom she had given to in hopes that she would get Daisuke to wear it). Despite her actions, she arrived too late at the Harada house seeing Daisuke and Riku out in the backyard, both with the magical charms around their necks. Unable to stop them, she used her powers to negate the charm's effect and sealed herself within Riku's charm before Hiwatari's father was able to negate her temporary life.    Before the series ended, Mio's spirit (sealed within Riku's charm) pleaded with the Harada twins to lend her their power so she could save Daisuke and Dark as well as Hiwatari's father. She then gains her own body back, using the Harada twins as a medium, and goes out to prevent Kei Hiwatari from activating the Black Wings in hopes of saving his life as well. Retaining some of her powers and using that of the Harada twins, she was able to stall Hiwatari from activating the Black Wings she was, however, unable to prevent his death. As the last of her power was used up, she left, telling the twins that she was glad to be able to do something to save Daisuke and Dark and requesting that they thank Daisuke for her, since it was through him that she was able to truly be alive.

Rubbing it off as a joke, Jun mindlessly does so only to find that his order instantly disappears from his drawer. A package suddenly appears, containing a beautiful antique doll.

Her desire to win the Alice Game is the strongest of all the dolls, and is primarily driven by her wish to gain the attention of \"Father\" (Rozen). Sadistic, spiteful, and arrogant (all due to her spectacular Superiority complex), Suigintou has no inhibitions when it comes to the Alice Game. She will use any method available to her, regardless of how brutal they may be, to grasp victory. Although she generally avoids associating with the other dolls on a social level, she has a particularly strong hate for Shinku. This hate borders on obsession, as she can approximate how many hours and minutes since they have last met. However, upon meeting Megu, her medium, Suigintou's attitude and motivations begin to shift; she begins to feel a strong affection for someone other than \"Father\". Suigintou's desire to protect Megu begins to even overpower her wish to meet him: she hopes to use the collected Rosa Mystica to heal Megu of her heart ailment, rather than become Alice.  Suigintou has a number of unique traits and flaws amongst the seven Rozen Maiden. In the anime, she is missing her torso; Shinku explains at one point that before Suigintou was completed, her design was erased, but gives no further explanation as to why or how. Curiously, after Suigintou is destroyed in battle by Shinku partly she is restored mid-way through Rozen Maiden Tr\u00e4umend. The identity of the person responsible for her restoration is never revealed. In the Rozen Maiden Tr\u00e4umend finale, she tells Shinku that \"Father\" had told her that even with her flawed body, she was also entitled to a part in the Alice Game. Later, Rozen is seen lovingly fixing her neck ribbon as she is unconscious. He even grips gently around the waist afterwards, implying that he has mended her incomplete body.   ~!In the manga, her body is flawed by wings (she is the only Rozen Maiden with them) that have ravaged her back with cracks. Despite these flaws, her love for \"Father\" and willpower is so strong that she can use her powers independently of a medium. Initially, Suigintou's will to exist was so strong that she was able to move without actually possessing a Rosa Mystica. Suigintou did not consciously make a contract with Megu, rather, Megu came upon Suigintou as she was reawakening. Suigintou's strong sense of independence, as well as disdain towards humanity, kept her avoiding having a medium. She is also the only Rozen Maiden to have been defeated and revived three times.  In Rozen Maiden Ouvert\u00fcre, her complete past is revealed. Her intense hatred for Shinku stems from the very moment of Suigintou's awakening, when she notices Rozen affixing a brooch with his image on Shinku's bow. Nevertheless, they still managed to be friends as Suigintou was ignorant of the Rozen Maidens' true purpose--destruction of one another through the Alice Game--when they meet in 19th century London. Suigintou stumbles through a mirror in the room of Shinku's medium, wailing hysterically for \"Father\". Shinku takes Suigintou in after determining that she is not a threat. Shinku not only teaches her how to walk, but also treats her as an equal. One day, she follows Shinku into an Alice Game battle with Souseiseki, and is cut in half by Souseiseki's shears. This reveals her incomplete body, and she vanishes into a watery N-Field where \"Father\" gives her a Rosa Mystica of her own at last, thus, making Suigintou a true Rozen Maiden. Not long after, Shinku admits that she only felt pity for the \"poor, unfinished doll\" that certainly couldn't become Alice and insinuates that Suigintou could not possibly be a Rozen Maiden because she is flawed and different from all the others. This angers Suigintou, and she releases her black wings for the first time, beginning an Alice Game battle with Shinku. She eventually pulls Rozen's brooch from Shinku's ribbon and crushes it in front of her eyes. As Suigintou laughs arrogantly at Shinku's anguish, Shinku calls her \"junk\" which acts as the reason she refers to the other dolls as \"junk\" (particularly Shinku) and why she greatly resents being called it herself. The fight between the two becomes even more intense, but Laplace no Ma ends the battle, stating that the Alice Game of that era has ended.!~  Along with her artificial spirit, Meimei, Suigintou's weapons are her ragged black wings. With their arrow-like feathers, she can conjure up a shield, a large sword, or even twin black dragons. Suigintou can also create destructive blue flames as a last resort in battle. The variety in Suigintou's abilities, particularly when combined with her savagely cunning nature, make her a strong player in the Alice Game.  It is noted that \"Mei\" in Japanese means darkness.  Medium: None (First Season)/Megu (Second Season)  Suigintou's name in English means, \"Mercury Lamp\"."}}, {"role": "MAIN", "voiceActors": [{"id": 95069, "name": {"first": "Julie Ann", "last": "Taylor"}}, {"id": 95210, "name": {"first": "Rika", "last": "Morinaga"}}, {"id": 96213, "name": {"first": "Dascha", "last": "Lehmann"}}, {"id": 109823, "name": {"first": "Mi Na", "last": "Yun"}}], "node": {"id": 1107, "name": {"first": "Souseiseki", "middle": null, "last": null, "full": "Souseiseki", "native": "\u84bc\u661f\u77f3", "alternative": ["Lapislazuri Stern", "Kadzuki"]}, "description": "The fourth Rozen Maiden doll, and Suiseiseki's tomboyish twin sister. As with Suiseiseki, she is a gardener that has the power to enter human dreams, and carries a set of pruning shears that she uses to tend humans' soul trees. She wields these in battle combined with acrobatic flight, her spirit Lempika and her hat which can be thrown and returns like a boomerang, a tactic she used to temporarily disarm Shinku in their second fight. She also has heterochromatic eyes like Suiseiseki, but the colors are the mirror image of her sister's. Her personality is also the polar opposite of Suiseiseki; she is rational, calm, quiet and deeply devoted to her master and to her duties, including the Alice Game. She possesses a sharpness in her speech that is similar to Shinku's, attacks ruthlessly in combat, and does not tolerate sub-par actions. Her appearance is not only the most masculine of the dolls, but her speech is also noted to be of the masculine form, using the first person pronoun \"boku\" instead of gender neutral pronouns like \"jibun\" or \"watashi.\" Souseiseki's presence is much more significant in the anime than in the manga.  In the manga, her master wanted to use Souseiseki's power to enter other people's dreams and exact revenge on his brother's lover, who he felt had stolen his brother from him. Since Souseiseki alone could not achieve this goal, she fights Suiseiseki to gather the two gardeners' tools, the shears of the Gardener and the watering can of the Gardener, which together can affect an individual's soul tree. She eventually realizes that it is her master's heart that needs to be freed and sacrifices herself to do.    ~!The dolls present are shocked by Souseiseki's actions and Suigintou uses the confusion to snatch Souseiseki's Rosa Mystica.!~ In the anime, Souseiseki is devoted to a lonesome old man, who uses her as a substitute for his deceased son, Kazuki. She is shown to be slightly more eager, probably from a sense of duty, to participate in the Alice Game than her sisters. In the OVA, she is introduced in the flashback in mid-fight with Shinku and later does not hold back in attacking a then-harmless Suigintou. Throughout Rozen Maiden tr\u00e4umend, she questions her idyllic lifestyle, and much to Suiseiseki's disappointment, takes part in the Alice Game out of devotion to Rozen, to fulfill his wish of finding Alice and relieve his perceived grief.    ~!She battles Suigintou, but is defeated and loses her Rosa Mystica.!~  ~!Even though the two versions progress differently, Souseiseki is still the first doll to lose her Rosa Mystica, and to Suigintou in both instances. However, at the end of Rozen Maiden tr\u00e4umend, Laplace is seen dancing with two Rosae Mysticae, one of which is believed to be Souseiseki's. To add to the confusion, after Shinku is resurrected by \"Father,\" she tells Jun that Souseiseki's and Hinaichigo's losing their Rosa Mystica's is her burden to bear. The most likely reson for this is that essentially they were under the care of her medium, which makes sense for Hinaichigo but only to an extent with Souseiseki. Though she is the first doll to lose her Rosa Mystica, Souseiseki is actually the second doll to lose in the Alice Game.!~  ~!Recently in the manga, Souseiseki's body was missing from her case. It was found out that Kirakishou used Souseiseki's body to be able to set foot on the human world. Kirakishou tried to stop Shinku, Suigintou and Suiseiseki from retrieving back Souseiseki's body by forcing older Jun to be her medium and permanently having that body. Though Jun accidentally made a contract on Suiseiseki's ring, which was sooner found out that it was Souseiseki's ring, Kirakishou started leaving her body. The only step needed to bring Souseiseki back is to get her rosa mystica from Suigintou.   Due to Suigintou's stuborness, she didn't give it back resulting Suiseiseki putting her own rosa mystica in her twin. They soon meet Souseiseki, revieved, with Suiseiseki, lifeless. Suigintou was telling Shinku that the Souseiseki they are seeing is a trap of the 7th doll, which the truth is not. According to Souseiseki, Rozen used to say that among seven rosa mysticas, the only two allocated to Suiseiseki and Souseiseki were different from others, by chance they were mutually paired in the begining and they were also called twin stones. Therefore, Suiseiseki took a chance on putting her rosa mystica into Souseiseki's body as substitution with knowledge of a risk of failure.  Suigintou described that Souseiseki's approach as unbeautiful. Souseiseki not just agreed with her but also thought that she needs to get the rosa mystica back to where it should be. Still, she intended not to do that then and there but to prioritized escaping from Kirakishou's field with Shinku and Suigintou.  Soon they all meet with older Jun and Kanaria, with Souseiseki introducing herself to her medium (since he made a contract with her). The group then saw a big imitation clock. Shinku and the others were discussing how to restart it. Souseiseki noticed the clock had been made of wood at that time and then she said she may well be able to make it re-activated if she gains the cooperation of Suiseiseki because they are capable of controlling plant lives.   To restart the clock, Souseiseki needed to resurrect Suiseiseki. And thus, Souseiseki tried borrowing her Rosa Mystica from Suigintou only during rebooting the clock by a deal that Souseiseki will really accept Suigintou as a winner and remove the pain lingering on Suigintou's body instead of borrowing the Rosa Mystica.  Suigintou first looked apparently unreluctant, she eventually seemed to approve the deal. In this way, Suiseiseki came back to life. Souseiseki, however, determined to tell Suiseiseki a lie for the first and last time before resurrecting her. So, about how Suiseiseki could be back in, Souseiseki just explained it to her as follows; \"Suigintou returned the Rosa Mystica.\" And then Suiseiseki ironically spoke to Suigintou, \"I think better of you than I did before.\"  Suiseiseki also asked Souseiseki, \"Can we be together for eternity after returning to the original world?\" and Souseiseki replied to her \"Yes.\" This is her first and last lie because Souseiseki promised to give her Rosa Mystica back to Suigintou after restarting the clock. !~  ~!After restarting the wooden clock, two branches were reveled. as this is the connection of the wound world and the not wound world. Then they saw how Shinku collapsed and broke into pieces for time has run out. While the older Jun was crying over what is happening to Shinku, Suigintou immediately demanded Souseiseki to do the deal. Suiseiseki was confused and was about to go after Suigintou but Souseiseki stops her and tells her the deal. Suigintou stopped Suiseiseki from interfering while Souseiseki was about to give her rosa mystica to Suigintou. But just in time, younger Jun and Kanaria returned to them with Shinku's real body. They explain what happened to the body and how Hina Ichigo's rosa mystica guarded the body. Suigintou was surprised in what Hina Ichigo did in spite that their destiny is the Alice Game. Suigintou told Souseiseki not to continue with the deal because this made her think. Though she told Souseiseki not to be mistaken because Souseiseki's body is just for storage, and her rosa mystica is still Suigintou's property.

She embodies the traditional Victorian aristocrat. Her favorite words are \"tea\", \"servant\" and \"What?\"  She regularly and nonchalantly delivers physical punishment to Jun, her medium, and in her own eyes, her servant.  She sees it as her duty not only to discipline Jun as her servant, but also to guide him as a guardian.\n\nShinku may seem cold and unappreciative, but she is highly protective of and cares deeply for her sisters and for Jun. She can be relied on for the occasional bit of parent-like wisdom. Despite her aristocratic quirks, Shinku is the most level-headed doll living in Jun's house.  However, her one weakness is her fear of imperfection; a fear that is powerful enough to shatter her normally cool demeanor.  Father put so much effort into her that she feels an obsessive need to become Alice.  In her eyes, the Alice Game is cruel, and she is reluctant to take the souls of her sisters, leaving them as the lifeless \"junk\" they fear more than anything else.  Shinku does not use honorific suffixes such as \"-chan,\" \"-san,\" or \"-kun,\" except when she refers to \"Father.\" Despite her relative youth amongst the Rozen Maidens, the other dolls look up to her as an older sister, and a worthy challenger in the Alice Game. Shinku does have a cute side, which is evident in her intense, almost obsessive, admiration for the puppet detective Kun Kun. Jun was once able to win her over during an argument by using a Kun Kun doll. Shinku hates cats because one almost ate her wind-up key in the past.  Along with being the central doll in the series, Shinku seems to hold a special place in \"Father\"'s heart; he had given her a special brooch with his image when she was created, which Suigintou destroyed out of jealousy. Shinku desires to become \"Alice,\" but she refuses to use deadly force against her sisters and believes that there must be a way to become Alice without taking part in the Alice Game as told to her by \"Father\".  In combat, Shinku fights with rose petal-based attacks, making her one of the strongest dolls in battle. The rose petals are extremely versatile; Shinku can direct them to spread out for wide-ranging attacks, or group them together to use as a shield. Her other weapon is a cane, which she skillfully wields like a sword. Shinku has other special powers, such as restoring broken objects, typically Jun's bedroom windows after Suiseiseki and Souseiseki show up, with a form of time-reversing magic. Shinku was the second runner-up for both Saimoe 2005 and 2007.  Medium: Jun (All Seasons)/Sara (In 19th Century) Artificial Spirit: Hollie (Called Hollier in Tokyopop translation.)

Their artificial spirits also allow them to access the dream worlds where such trees are located. Suiseiseki must call upon her artificial spirit to summon her watering can which she uses to nourish the \"soul trees\" and to launch her plant attacks. She makes an impression with her high-pitched voice, heterochromatic eyes (her left eye is green and her right eye is red), and frequent use of the sentence-ending copula \"desu\". She is described by Shinku as \"the most timid and shy of the sisters\" in the first season and even as a crybaby in Ouvert\u00fcre. She is quite easily scared of strange noises, and prefers to hide behind her sisters in the presence of strangers. With those she is acquainted however, she shows a very devious personality. Suiseiseki adores the spotlight, and her favorite activities include smashing the window of Jun's room (hitting Jun in the process frequently), picking mercilessly on Hinaichigo, and cackling maniacally. She has a wild imagination, a short temper and a fondness for telling wild lies to terrify Hinaichigo, whom she calls either \"chibi-chibi\" (tiny tiny) or \"chibi-ichigo\" (tiny strawberry). For the most part, Suiseiseki and Jun seem incapable of being civil with each other; she refuses to call Jun by name, opting for \"runt\" (\"chibi-ningen,\" which translates to \"little human\") instead.  Despite her attitude towards Jun, she does care a great deal for him, and her attempts to cover that up usually manifest in the form of more insults. In Rozen Maiden tr\u00e4umend, Suiseiseki stands out among the dolls in that she values her sisters' love more than the goal of becoming Alice. She is one of the few dolls who opposes the Alice Game, and has no intentions of becoming Alice if it means taking her fellow sisters' Rosa Mystica. Suiseiseki and Jun attempt, without much success, to convince the other Rozen Maidens that the Alice Game is a meaningless endeavor. In her brief appearance in the OVA, she makes the same appeal to her twin several times.  Suiseiseki tries to avoid participating in the Alice Game as much as possible, but she can use her watering can to make plants emerge from the ground and manipulate them.

Her disposition is also a mismatch for her power, which is a series of attacks based on strawberry vines, which she mostly uses to restrain opponents. She is beaten by Shinku in the Alice Game, becoming the first doll to lose the ability to become Alice. Shinku does not beat Hinaichigo outright; the younger doll simply exhausted the energy of her medium, Tomoe. Shinku then warned Hinaichigo that continuing the fight would kill Tomoe, whereupon Hinaichigo renounced the tie that made Tomoe her medium. Despite being the victor, Shinku does not take Hinaichigo's Rosa Mystica. Instead, Shinku lets herself be an inter-medium so that Hinaichigo can tap into Jun's energy.  ~!In the latter half of Rozen Maiden tr\u00e4umend, with the Alice Game apparently having begun in earnest, \"Father\" cuts off this link, so when Hinaichigo uses up what little energy she has, she loses her Rosa Mystica to Shinku. She is the second doll to lose her Rosa Mystica.  In the manga, Hinaichigo is taken from Jun after Odille Fosset, granddaughter of a previous owner of Hinaichigo, arrives at the Sakurada home and displays a ring, apparently from Hinaichigo, on her finger. Though Jun tells Hinaichigo that she may choose who to stay with, Hinaichigo apparently does not consciously decide to go with Odille; after awakening from sleep, Hinaichigo is confused to find herself in Odille's room, which she recognizes as that of Odille's grandmother, Corinne. Shortly afterwards, Hinaichigo is destroyed in quite disturbing fashion by Kirakishou; after telling her to say goodbye to everyone, Kirakishou uses her rose vines to consume Hinaichigo from the inside out. Hinaichigo sends her Rosa Mystica to Shinku through Berrybell, her artificial spirit, asking Shinku to use the Rosa Mystica to end the Alice Game.!~  Hinaichigo's favorite foods are strawberry daifuku, which she calls \"unyuu,\" and Nori's \"Hanamaru Hamburger,\" which is a hamburger patty topped with a fried egg in the shape of a flower. She adores the puppet detective Kun Kun, though her fandom is not as avid as Shinku's. She also loves to draw, as shown often in both seasons of the anime and the OVA. She usually ends her sentences in \"na no\" (meaning \"that's why\" or \"because\" in Japanese), complimentary to Kanaria's \"kashira\" (meaning \"I wonder\" or \"maybe?\").  In the anime, Hinaichigo's singing and her arguments with Suiseiseki are actually ad-libbed by her seiyuus.

She now realizes that Suigintou's fate may very well befall the other Dolls, for the appearance of the last Doll signals the beginning of the end of the Alice Games.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)", "startDate": {"year": 2005, "month": 10, "day": 21}, "endDate": {"year": 2006, "month": 1, "day": 27}, "season": "FALL", "seasonYear": 2005, "seasonInt": 54, "episodes": 12, "duration": 24, "chapters": null, "volumes": null, "countryOfOrigin": "JP", "source": "MANGA", "genres": ["Action", "Comedy", "Drama"], "synonyms": ["Rozen Maiden: Traumend", "Rozen Maiden 2"], "averageScore": 72, "meanScore": 72, "popularity": 13117, "trending": 0, "favourites": 111, "tags": [{"id": 101, "name": "Battle Royale"}, {"id": 29, "name": "Magic"}, {"id": 82, "name": "Male Protagonist"}, {"id": 87, "name": "Family Life"}, {"id": 321, "name": "Urban Fantasy"}, {"id": 50, "name": "Seinen"}, {"id": 1277, "name": "Found Family"}, {"id": 595, "name": "Urban"}, {"id": 1304, "name": "Anthropomorphism"}, {"id": 86, "name": "Primarily Female Cast"}, {"id": 85, "name": "Tragedy"}, {"id": 282, "name": "Hikikomori"}, {"id": 311, "name": "Rehabilitation"}, {"id": 780, "name": "Ojou-sama"}, {"id": 46, "name": "School"}, {"id": 164, "name": "Tsundere"}, {"id": 779, "name": "Kuudere"}, {"id": 66, "name": "Super Power"}], "isAdult": false, "characters": {"edges": [{"role": "MAIN", "voiceActors": [{"id": 95060, "name": {"first": "Rie", "last": "Tanaka"}}, {"id": 96054, "name": {"first": "Karen", "last": "Strassman"}}, {"id": 102285, "name": {"first": "Claire", "last": "Tefnin"}}, {"id": 109755, "name": {"first": "Jeong-Hwa", "last": "Yang"}}, {"id": 101108, "name": {"first": "Maria", "last": "Koschny"}}], "node": {"id": 1072, "name": {"first": "Suigintou", "middle": null, "last": null, "full": "Suigintou", "native": "\u6c34\u9280\u71c8", "alternative": ["Mercury Lampe", "Kurobara", "Black Rose", "Death Angel", "Gin-chan"]}, "description": "Suigintou is the first doll of the Rozen Maiden collection. Her desire to win the Alice Game is the strongest of all the dolls, and is primarily driven by her wish to gain the attention of \"Father\" (Rozen). Sadistic, spiteful, and arrogant (all due to her spectacular Superiority complex), Suigintou has no inhibitions when it comes to the Alice Game. She will use any method available to her, regardless of how brutal they may be, to grasp victory. Although she generally avoids associating with the other dolls on a social level, she has a particularly strong hate for Shinku. This hate borders on obsession, as she can approximate how many hours and minutes since they have last met. However, upon meeting Megu, her medium, Suigintou's attitude and motivations begin to shift; she begins to feel a strong affection for someone other than \"Father\". Suigintou's desire to protect Megu begins to even overpower her wish to meet him: she hopes to use the collected Rosa Mystica to heal Megu of her heart ailment, rather than become Alice.  Suigintou has a number of unique traits and flaws amongst the seven Rozen Maiden. In the anime, she is missing her torso; Shinku explains at one point that before Suigintou was completed, her design was erased, but gives no further explanation as to why or how. Curiously, after Suigintou is destroyed in battle by Shinku partly she is restored mid-way through Rozen Maiden Tr\u00e4umend. The identity of the person responsible for her restoration is never revealed. In the Rozen Maiden Tr\u00e4umend finale, she tells Shinku that \"Father\" had told her that even with her flawed body, she was also entitled to a part in the Alice Game. Later, Rozen is seen lovingly fixing her neck ribbon as she is unconscious. He even grips gently around the waist afterwards, implying that he has mended her incomplete body.   ~!In the manga, her body is flawed by wings (she is the only Rozen Maiden with them) that have ravaged her back with cracks. Despite these flaws, her love for \"Father\" and willpower is so strong that she can use her powers independently of a medium. Initially, Suigintou's will to exist was so strong that she was able to move without actually possessing a Rosa Mystica. Suigintou did not consciously make a contract with Megu, rather, Megu came upon Suigintou as she was reawakening. Suigintou's strong sense of independence, as well as disdain towards humanity, kept her avoiding having a medium. She is also the only Rozen Maiden to have been defeated and revived three times.  In Rozen Maiden Ouvert\u00fcre, her complete past is revealed. Her intense hatred for Shinku stems from the very moment of Suigintou's awakening, when she notices Rozen affixing a brooch with his image on Shinku's bow. Nevertheless, they still managed to be friends as Suigintou was ignorant of the Rozen Maidens' true purpose--destruction of one another through the Alice Game--when they meet in 19th century London. Suigintou stumbles through a mirror in the room of Shinku's medium, wailing hysterically for \"Father\". Shinku takes Suigintou in after determining that she is not a threat. Shinku not only teaches her how to walk, but also treats her as an equal. One day, she follows Shinku into an Alice Game battle with Souseiseki, and is cut in half by Souseiseki's shears. This reveals her incomplete body, and she vanishes into a watery N-Field where \"Father\" gives her a Rosa Mystica of her own at last, thus, making Suigintou a true Rozen Maiden. Not long after, Shinku admits that she only felt pity for the \"poor, unfinished doll\" that certainly couldn't become Alice and insinuates that Suigintou could not possibly be a Rozen Maiden because she is flawed and different from all the others. This angers Suigintou, and she releases her black wings for the first time, beginning an Alice Game battle with Shinku. She eventually pulls Rozen's brooch from Shinku's ribbon and crushes it in front of her eyes. As Suigintou laughs arrogantly at Shinku's anguish, Shinku calls her \"junk\" which acts as the reason she refers to the other dolls as \"junk\" (particularly Shinku) and why she greatly resents being called it herself. The fight between the two becomes even more intense, but Laplace no Ma ends the battle, stating that the Alice Game of that era has ended.!~  Along with her artificial spirit, Meimei, Suigintou's weapons are her ragged black wings. With their arrow-like feathers, she can conjure up a shield, a large sword, or even twin black dragons. Suigintou can also create destructive blue flames as a last resort in battle. The variety in Suigintou's abilities, particularly when combined with her savagely cunning nature, make her a strong player in the Alice Game.  It is noted that \"Mei\" in Japanese means darkness.

As with Suiseiseki, she is a gardener that has the power to enter human dreams, and carries a set of pruning shears that she uses to tend humans' soul trees. She wields these in battle combined with acrobatic flight, her spirit Lempika and her hat which can be thrown and returns like a boomerang, a tactic she used to temporarily disarm Shinku in their second fight. She also has heterochromatic eyes like Suiseiseki, but the colors are the mirror image of her sister's. Her personality is also the polar opposite of Suiseiseki; she is rational, calm, quiet and deeply devoted to her master and to her duties, including the Alice Game. She possesses a sharpness in her speech that is similar to Shinku's, attacks ruthlessly in combat, and does not tolerate sub-par actions. Her appearance is not only the most masculine of the dolls, but her speech is also noted to be of the masculine form, using the first person pronoun \"boku\" instead of gender neutral pronouns like \"jibun\" or \"watashi.\" Souseiseki's presence is much more significant in the anime than in the manga.  In the manga, her master wanted to use Souseiseki's power to enter other people's dreams and exact revenge on his brother's lover, who he felt had stolen his brother from him. Since Souseiseki alone could not achieve this goal, she fights Suiseiseki to gather the two gardeners' tools, the shears of the Gardener and the watering can of the Gardener, which together can affect an individual's soul tree. She eventually realizes that it is her master's heart that needs to be freed and sacrifices herself to do.    ~!The dolls present are shocked by Souseiseki's actions and Suigintou uses the confusion to snatch Souseiseki's Rosa Mystica.!~ In the anime, Souseiseki is devoted to a lonesome old man, who uses her as a substitute for his deceased son, Kazuki. She is shown to be slightly more eager, probably from a sense of duty, to participate in the Alice Game than her sisters. In the OVA, she is introduced in the flashback in mid-fight with Shinku and later does not hold back in attacking a then-harmless Suigintou. Throughout Rozen Maiden tr\u00e4umend, she questions her idyllic lifestyle, and much to Suiseiseki's disappointment, takes part in the Alice Game out of devotion to Rozen, to fulfill his wish of finding Alice and relieve his perceived grief.    ~!She battles Suigintou, but is defeated and loses her Rosa Mystica.!~  ~!Even though the two versions progress differently, Souseiseki is still the first doll to lose her Rosa Mystica, and to Suigintou in both instances. However, at the end of Rozen Maiden tr\u00e4umend, Laplace is seen dancing with two Rosae Mysticae, one of which is believed to be Souseiseki's. To add to the confusion, after Shinku is resurrected by \"Father,\" she tells Jun that Souseiseki's and Hinaichigo's losing their Rosa Mystica's is her burden to bear. The most likely reson for this is that essentially they were under the care of her medium, which makes sense for Hinaichigo but only to an extent with Souseiseki. Though she is the first doll to lose her Rosa Mystica, Souseiseki is actually the second doll to lose in the Alice Game.!~  ~!Recently in the manga, Souseiseki's body was missing from her case. It was found out that Kirakishou used Souseiseki's body to be able to set foot on the human world. Kirakishou tried to stop Shinku, Suigintou and Suiseiseki from retrieving back Souseiseki's body by forcing older Jun to be her medium and permanently having that body. Though Jun accidentally made a contract on Suiseiseki's ring, which was sooner found out that it was Souseiseki's ring, Kirakishou started leaving her body. The only step needed to bring Souseiseki back is to get her rosa mystica from Suigintou.   Due to Suigintou's stuborness, she didn't give it back resulting Suiseiseki putting her own rosa mystica in her twin. They soon meet Souseiseki, revieved, with Suiseiseki, lifeless. Suigintou was telling Shinku that the Souseiseki they are seeing is a trap of the 7th doll, which the truth is not. According to Souseiseki, Rozen used to say that among seven rosa mysticas, the only two allocated to Suiseiseki and Souseiseki were different from others, by chance they were mutually paired in the begining and they were also called twin stones. Therefore, Suiseiseki took a chance on putting her rosa mystica into Souseiseki's body as substitution with knowledge of a risk of failure.  Suigintou described that Souseiseki's approach as unbeautiful. Souseiseki not just agreed with her but also thought that she needs to get the rosa mystica back to where it should be. Still, she intended not to do that then and there but to prioritized escaping from Kirakishou's field with Shinku and Suigintou.  Soon they all meet with older Jun and Kanaria, with Souseiseki introducing herself to her medium (since he made a contract with her). The group then saw a big imitation clock. Shinku and the others were discussing how to restart it. Souseiseki noticed the clock had been made of wood at that time and then she said she may well be able to make it re-activated if she gains the cooperation of Suiseiseki because they are capable of controlling plant lives.   To restart the clock, Souseiseki needed to resurrect Suiseiseki. And thus, Souseiseki tried borrowing her Rosa Mystica from Suigintou only during rebooting the clock by a deal that Souseiseki will really accept Suigintou as a winner and remove the pain lingering on Suigintou's body instead of borrowing the Rosa Mystica.  Suigintou first looked apparently unreluctant, she eventually seemed to approve the deal. In this way, Suiseiseki came back to life. Souseiseki, however, determined to tell Suiseiseki a lie for the first and last time before resurrecting her. So, about how Suiseiseki could be back in, Souseiseki just explained it to her as follows; \"Suigintou returned the Rosa Mystica.\" And then Suiseiseki ironically spoke to Suigintou, \"I think better of you than I did before.\"  Suiseiseki also asked Souseiseki, \"Can we be together for eternity after returning to the original world?\" and Souseiseki replied to her \"Yes.\" This is her first and last lie because Souseiseki promised to give her Rosa Mystica back to Suigintou after restarting the clock. !~  ~!After restarting the wooden clock, two branches were reveled. as this is the connection of the wound world and the not wound world. Then they saw how Shinku collapsed and broke into pieces for time has run out. While the older Jun was crying over what is happening to Shinku, Suigintou immediately demanded Souseiseki to do the deal. Suiseiseki was confused and was about to go after Suigintou but Souseiseki stops her and tells her the deal. Suigintou stopped Suiseiseki from interfering while Souseiseki was about to give her rosa mystica to Suigintou. But just in time, younger Jun and Kanaria returned to them with Shinku's real body. They explain what happened to the body and how Hina Ichigo's rosa mystica guarded the body. Suigintou was surprised in what Hina Ichigo did in spite that their destiny is the Alice Game. Suigintou told Souseiseki not to continue with the deal because this made her think. Though she told Souseiseki not to be mistaken because Souseiseki's body is just for storage, and her rosa mystica is still Suigintou's property. Suigintou flew away while Suiseiseki was relieved and overjoyed being with her twin sister again. Older Jun told Souseiseki that her ring will go to the younger Jun in their world since both of them are still the same person.!~ Her artificial spirit is named for a fragrance by Lolita Lempicka.

She sees it as her duty not only to discipline Jun as her servant, but also to guide him as a guardian.\n\nShinku may seem cold and unappreciative, but she is highly protective of and cares deeply for her sisters and for Jun. She can be relied on for the occasional bit of parent-like wisdom. Despite her aristocratic quirks, Shinku is the most level-headed doll living in Jun's house.  However, her one weakness is her fear of imperfection; a fear that is powerful enough to shatter her normally cool demeanor.  Father put so much effort into her that she feels an obsessive need to become Alice.  In her eyes, the Alice Game is cruel, and she is reluctant to take the souls of her sisters, leaving them as the lifeless \"junk\" they fear more than anything else.  Shinku does not use honorific suffixes such as \"-chan,\" \"-san,\" or \"-kun,\" except when she refers to \"Father.\" Despite her relative youth amongst the Rozen Maidens, the other dolls look up to her as an older sister, and a worthy challenger in the Alice Game. Shinku does have a cute side, which is evident in her intense, almost obsessive, admiration for the puppet detective Kun Kun. Jun was once able to win her over during an argument by using a Kun Kun doll. Shinku hates cats because one almost ate her wind-up key in the past.  Along with being the central doll in the series, Shinku seems to hold a special place in \"Father\"'s heart; he had given her a special brooch with his image when she was created, which Suigintou destroyed out of jealousy. Shinku desires to become \"Alice,\" but she refuses to use deadly force against her sisters and believes that there must be a way to become Alice without taking part in the Alice Game as told to her by \"Father\".  In combat, Shinku fights with rose petal-based attacks, making her one of the strongest dolls in battle. The rose petals are extremely versatile; Shinku can direct them to spread out for wide-ranging attacks, or group them together to use as a shield. Her other weapon is a cane, which she skillfully wields like a sword. Shinku has other special powers, such as restoring broken objects, typically Jun's bedroom windows after Suiseiseki and Souseiseki show up, with a form of time-reversing magic.

Suiseiseki must call upon her artificial spirit to summon her watering can which she uses to nourish the \"soul trees\" and to launch her plant attacks. She makes an impression with her high-pitched voice, heterochromatic eyes (her left eye is green and her right eye is red), and frequent use of the sentence-ending copula \"desu\".

Shinku then warned Hinaichigo that continuing the fight would kill Tomoe, whereupon Hinaichigo renounced the tie that made Tomoe her medium.

She is clad entirely in lavender and wears an eyepatch over her left eye, though she is revealed to not be missing an eye at all. The eyepatch seems to act as a seal over her emotions, since she only shows a personality when it is removed. In the first and last episodes of Rozen Maiden tr&auml;umend, she deliberately parrots whatever Shinku says to her in an effort to annoy her. Barasuishou is unnaturally calm most of the time, apparently possessing no conscience, and is an extremely powerful adversary in battle. She is also hinted to be mad; when Shinku has her pinned to the floor towards the end of their battle, Barasuishou simply giggles and smiles disarmingly at Shinku. She has the ability to create and manipulate all sorts of crystalline elements, including glass.    Barasuishou&#039;s appearance marks the &quot;true&quot; start of the Alice Game.      ~!Her &quot;Father&quot; is Enju, who was initially believed to be Rozen himself, but is merely Rozen&#039;s jealous apprentice. Barasuishou&#039;s true origin is revealed in the final episode of Rozen Maiden tr&auml;umend. Enju was obsessed with surpassing Rozen as the greatest dollmaker; to achieve that end, he created Barasuishou to oppose the Rozen Maidens, take their Rosa Mysticae, and finish as the last doll standing. The elements of Barasuishou&#039;s attire and overall appearance suggest that Enju had seen Rozen&#039;s design for Kirakishou and created Barasuishou from his recollection of it. Barasuishou is believed to have died after being unable to contain the power of the six Rosa Mysticae she absorbed; despite Enju&#039;s plea for her to release the Rosa Mystica once he realized the truth, she continued to cry out to &quot;Father&quot; and crumbled to pieces in Enju&#039;s hands.!~    Barasuishou appears only in Rozen Maiden tr&auml;umend and in one scene of the OVA.

He is of Afghan and Japanese heritage. While he is inherently Japanese due to his name, Sagara grew up in Helmajistan, a region in Afghanistan that was caught up in political strife. At age 8, he joined a guerrilla movement to survive, and was eventually recruited by Mithril. Sousuke only knows military life and as a result he does not handle the everyday occurrences of civilian life very well. He also has a tough time integrating into high school life as his social skills are not quite up to par. His military bearing and encyclopedic knowledge of weapons earns him the nickname 'Military Maniac'. The basic problem this causes is, for instance, how he blows up the shoes lockers if there is any clue that someone has tampered with them. Sousuke can be quite insensitive at times, for example in volume 7 he bought a pregnancy test while out with Kaname and did not understand what was wrong, though his intentions are always in the right place. His deep feelings for Chidori Kaname are unavoidably clear by the beginning of TSR when he punches his fist through a laptop with the message of his direct order to not contact her anymore. Sousuke eventually decides to give up his life as a soldier and retires from Mithril, deciding that he wanted to be with Chidori instead.

He has the call sign Urzu-6 and his ID number is B-3127. He is an SRT Arm Slave pilot and designated marksman, equally proficient with sniper rifles and Arm Slave long range precision cannons. It is said he can visualize the exact trajectory of a bullet, resulting in an almost inhuman accuracy. He most often forms a three-man cell with squadmate Sousuke Sagara and squad leader Melissa Mao. He is regarded as a finicky genius, burdening the Mithril mechanics with extremely difficult to understand complaints and requests.    Kurz is a Caucasian male, roughly six feet tall. He is of German decent, and sports a blond mullet and has blue eyes. He is very good looking, and combined with his outgoing personality easily befriends most people. His reputation with women in romantic terms is largely spoiled by his unflinching and overdone pursuit of &quot;the fairer sex&quot;.    Kurz can speak Japanese, English and German fluently. He had aspirations of becoming a professional blues singer before he was a soldier. From this, Kurz can sing and play the guitar quite well, entertaining the ersatz hostage Jindai High students with his rendition of &quot;Take me out Mariana Trench!&quot; in the novel, A Dancing Very Merry Christmas!.    In the scope of the main anime and novel series, Kurz is shown being deployed in Tokyo with Melissa and Sousuke in protecting Kaname Chidori. During the course of the show, he displays his extreme talent with a WA2000 rifle. A notable shot is made from a back of a moving truck into the open gun port of the 30mm GAU-8 Avenger cannon of the Behemoth. Later, Kurz assists Sousuke in subduing John Danigan and Guen Bien Bo, two SRT members turned defectors after Gauron had hijacked the Tuatha de Danaan. His hand to hand combat skills in this incident are harshly judged as being &ldquo;worse than a city punk&rdquo; by Melissa Mao.    He is known to be a hard hitter on women and speaks in vulgar and flippant language. Despite the negative attitude he has received from women, he is still Sousuke&#039;s best friend from Mithril. Kurz annoys Melissa Mao greatly due to the open nature of his sexual feelings for her. In essence, he is Sousuke&#039;s complete opposite in personality.    At the time of the novel &quot;Dancing Very Merry Christmas!&quot;, 1st Lieutenant Grouseax and the newly-promoted 2nd Lieutenant Melissa Mao placed him under observation for promotion to Sergeant Major. In the serialised novel &quot;Tsudou to Make My Day&quot;, Kurz is the SRT&#039;s Sergeant Major.

Tessa seems to have some trouble tolerating her job at times due to the position she has. Some scenes have shown her irritated by what she does while other scenes show her slightly depressed by it. Nevertheless, she seems to have a large amount of stamina, and is able to cope with the stress of her tasks, and does a wonderful job doing so.

He is of Afghan and Japanese heritage. While he is inherently Japanese due to his name, Sagara grew up in Helmajistan, a region in Afghanistan that was caught up in political strife. At age 8, he joined a guerrilla movement to survive, and was eventually recruited by Mithril. Sousuke only knows military life and as a result he does not handle the everyday occurrences of civilian life very well. He also has a tough time integrating into high school life as his social skills are not quite up to par. His military bearing and encyclopedic knowledge of weapons earns him the nickname 'Military Maniac'. The basic problem this causes is, for instance, how he blows up the shoes lockers if there is any clue that someone has tampered with them. Sousuke can be quite insensitive at times, for example in volume 7 he bought a pregnancy test while out with Kaname and did not understand what was wrong, though his intentions are always in the right place. His deep feelings for Chidori Kaname are unavoidably clear by the beginning of TSR when he punches his fist through a laptop with the message of his direct order to not contact her anymore. Sousuke eventually decides to give up his life as a soldier and retires from Mithril, deciding that he wanted to be with Chidori instead. Upon his return, Sousuke confirms his feelings for Chidori and the two share a kiss in the school court yard.\n\nAlso, he was formerly known as 'Kashim' according to Gauron."}}, {"role": "MAIN", "voiceActors": [{"id": 95003, "name": {"first": "Satsuki", "last": "Yukino"}}, {"id": 95189, "name": {"first": "Luci", "last": "Christian"}}, {"id": 95768, "name": {"first": "Perla", "last": "Liberatori"}}], "node": {"id": 272, "name": {"first": "Kaname", "middle": null, "last": "Chidori", "full": "Kaname Chidori", "native": "\u5343\u9ce5\u304b\u306a\u3081", "alternative": ["Kana"]}, "description": "__Height__: 166 cm\n__Place of Birth__: Japan\n__Hobbies__: Softball\n\nKaname is the female protagonist of the series.

She's very much the loud mouth, speak your mind kind of girl; a trait she picked up when she studied abroad in the United States. Until then, she feels like she must protect Sousuke from the harsh, cruel world of high school - a place where he doesn't quite fit.\n\nSousuke is assigned to guard her as she is one of the \"Whispered\". People that have in their subconscious very technologically advanced knowledge that numerous governments and other groups want to use for their own means.\n\nShe often uses a paper fan to hit Sousuke, besides berating him on how the kinds of weapons he uses are not exactly proper for a high school student. While she criticizes Sousuke for being too militaristic and overprotective, she appreciates it under life or death situations. Chidori develops serious feelings for Sousuke and is dejected when he is so obtuse in such matters. Eventually Chidori confesses her love to Sousuke and the latter reciprocates it. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"}}, {"role": "SUPPORTING", "voiceActors": [{"id": 95022, "name": {"first": "Shinichirou", "last": "Miki"}}, {"id": 95043, "name": {"first": "Vic", "last": "Mignogna"}}, {"id": 165553, "name": {"first": "Francesco", "last": "Pezzulli"}}], "node": {"id": 2168, "name": {"first": "Kurz", "middle": null, "last": "Weber", "full": "Kurz Weber", "native": "\u30af\u30eb\u30c4\u30fb\u30a6\u30a7\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc", "alternative": []}, "description": "Name: Kurz Weber  Height: 180 cm  Weight: 70 kg    Place of Birth: Japan  Distinguishing features: Blonde hair, Blue eyes  Rank: Sergeant  Codename: Urzu 6    Kurz is a member of Mithril and has the rank of Sergeant in the SRT (Special Response Team) of the Tuatha de Danaan (TDD-1) Pacific Battle Group. He has the call sign Urzu-6 and his ID number is B-3127. He is an SRT Arm Slave pilot and designated marksman, equally proficient with sniper rifles and Arm Slave long range precision cannons. It is said he can visualize the exact trajectory of a bullet, resulting in an almost inhuman accuracy. He most often forms a three-man cell with squadmate Sousuke Sagara and squad leader Melissa Mao. He is regarded as a finicky genius, burdening the Mithril mechanics with extremely difficult to understand complaints and requests.    Kurz is a Caucasian male, roughly six feet tall. He is of German decent, and sports a blond mullet and has blue eyes. He is very good looking, and combined with his outgoing personality easily befriends most people. His reputation with women in romantic terms is largely spoiled by his unflinching and overdone pursuit of &quot;the fairer sex&quot;.    Kurz can speak Japanese, English and German fluently. He had aspirations of becoming a professional blues singer before he was a soldier. From this, Kurz can sing and play the guitar quite well, entertaining the ersatz hostage Jindai High students with his rendition of &quot;Take me out Mariana Trench!&quot; in the novel, A Dancing Very Merry Christmas!.    In the scope of the main anime and novel series, Kurz is shown being deployed in Tokyo with Melissa and Sousuke in protecting Kaname Chidori. During the course of the show, he displays his extreme talent with a WA2000 rifle. A notable shot is made from a back of a moving truck into the open gun port of the 30mm GAU-8 Avenger cannon of the Behemoth. Later, Kurz assists Sousuke in subduing John Danigan and Guen Bien Bo, two SRT members turned defectors after Gauron had hijacked the Tuatha de Danaan. His hand to hand combat skills in this incident are harshly judged as being &ldquo;worse than a city punk&rdquo; by Melissa Mao.    He is known to be a hard hitter on women and speaks in vulgar and flippant language. Despite the negative attitude he has received from women, he is still Sousuke&#039;s best friend from Mithril. Kurz annoys Melissa Mao greatly due to the open nature of his sexual feelings for her. In essence, he is Sousuke&#039;s complete opposite in personality.    At the time of the novel &quot;Dancing Very Merry Christmas!&quot;, 1st Lieutenant Grouseax and the newly-promoted 2nd Lieutenant Melissa Mao placed him under observation for promotion to Sergeant Major. In the serialised novel &quot;Tsudou to Make My Day&quot;, Kurz is the SRT&#039;s Sergeant Major.

She is also very smart when it comes to battlefield tactics and conflicts and she displays some very impressive military prowess and strategy at several points.

Tessa seems to have some trouble tolerating her job at times due to the position she has. Some scenes have shown her irritated by what she does while other scenes show her slightly depressed by it. Nevertheless, she seems to have a large amount of stamina, and is able to cope with the stress of her tasks, and does a wonderful job doing so.

The foster father status may be on the school&#039;s official papers only but Kalinin is certainly a very fatherly figure to Sagara. Kalinin was formerly of the Soviet special forces - Spetsnaz - and was the leader of the team that found a crashed Japanese airliner. There was only one survivor: a three year-old child by the name of Sagara Sousuke. His wife is deceased and the whereabouts and status of the rest of his family is unknown. There is speculation that Kalinin has betrayed Mithril to Amalgam, due to his meeting with Leonard Testarossa at the end of the book &#039;Dancing Very Merry Christmas&#039; and also due to his mysterious disappearance and attitude during the raid by Amalgam on Merida Island. Kalinin later appears in &#039;Tsudoku to Make My Day&#039; at Leonard&#039;s villa, apparently as one of Leonard&#039;s subordinates, although his subsequent actions in the book suggest the possibility that he may be working for the anti-Leonard faction of Amalgam, or as a Mithril deep cover agent.    Andrei mentioned that he had difficulty maintaining family ties, mostly with his wife, due to his time spent with the Spetsnaz. He seems to be of a family man sort and loves his wife so much that he made the Borscht (that Sousuke avoids at all costs) that his wife made him as he returns from missions.

AL becomes permanently locked to Sousuke after his initial use of AL during the hijacking incident.  Also, because the original programmer is dead it is impossible to reprogram AL to work with anyone other than Sousuke.  At the beginning of the series AL is nothing more than your average arm slave operating system, but as the series progresses AL starts to develop a personality much to Sousuke's dismay.  AL begins tuning into AM/FM band radio stations in an effort to expand its vocabulary, cultural understanding, and social knowledge.  This all leads AL to occasionally attempt to tell Sousuke jokes, criticize Sousuke's own short comings, or make random exclamations and comments during the midst of battle.      During the two \"End of Day by Day\" novels Sousuke and AL's conflict really comes to a head and their inability to work together causes the Arbalest's Lambda Driver to become almost completely unusable.  Because of this, Sousuke begins to detest the Arbalest and asks to be allowed to pilot a regular M9 during his missions.  However, by the end of the two novels they were able to eventually find a mutual respect for one another and are able to operate the Lambda Driver system at a level exceeding all previous examples.  During the Novels \"A Dancing Very Merry Christmas\" and \"Continuing On My Own\" AL shows that it is now capable of preforming autonomous advanced battle maneuvers and making precision shots with the Arbalest's projectile weaponry.  AL developed this ability by reviewing and analyzing all of the combat data that it has acquired while working with Sousuke over the previous 9 months.  Immediately following the final battle in the novel \"Continuing On My Own\", AL along with the Lambda Driver is recovered from the wreckage of the destroyed Arbalest by Wraith.  Towards the end of the novel \"Burning One Man Force\" is is discovered that Wraith has transported AL and the Arbalest's Lambda Driver to a surviving Mithril base in Anchorage, Alaska.  While there AL has worked together with Sarah Miller to design and build a whole new Arm Slave tailored specifically to match Sousuke's combat style.  The new AS is called the ARX-8 Laevatein, named after a legendary sword in Norse mythology called the Laevateinn.  In the novel \"Come Make My Day\" AL and Sousuke have a one-on-one conversation where both admit that they have missed one another ever since the destruction of the Arbalest. By this time, AL appears to have \"matured\" enough to hold a personality mirroring that of Sousuke's (if the latter had grown up in different conditions); however, his jokes and comments have not lessen at all, keeping to the offbeat comedic mood of the Full Metal Panic! storyline."}}, {"role": "SUPPORTING", "voiceActors": [{"id": 95159, "name": {"first": "Monica", "last": "Rial"}}, {"id": 95767, "name": {"first": "Federica", "last": "De Bortoli"}}, {"id": 96688, "name": {"first": "Ikue", "last": "Kimura"}}], "node": {"id": 2745, "name": {"first": "Kyoko", "middle": null, "last": "Tokiwa", "full": "Kyoko Tokiwa", "native": "\u5e38\u76e4\u606d\u5b50", "alternative": []}, "description": "Chidori&#039;s humble best friend who brings around her trusty camera.

The second time he disguised himself as a substitute teacher named Serio in one of Natsume&#039;s exams to see who was the cause of Natsume&#039;s change (but he was found out easily by Natsume).

Alisa is an outspoken, dog-loving Anglophone and multimillionaire heiress. She gets angry at Nanoha halfway through the series for keeping secrets from her friends. Despite this, she cares deeply for her friend. She is a strong-willed person the apparent leader in her small circle of friends.

Alisa is proficient with English and loves dogs, owning about ten at her large mansion.

Nanoha and Yuuno eventually met with Arf at Alisa's home.  In A's, Alisa's role is greatly reduced. Though she takes the lead of helping the new foreign student, Fate, in her integration of Japanese lifestyle, her few on-screen appearances are mostly of her worrying about the fact that Nanoha and Fate are keeping secrets from her and Suzuka. Upon meeting with Arf in her puppy form, Alisa noted that she seemed strangely familiar to her. Alisa and Suzuka are trapped in a magical barrier and bear witness to Nanoha and Fate's battle with Hayate possessed by the Book of Darkness.

It is soon apparent that even Fate does not know why she is looking for these specimens of Lost Logia (the series' term for ancient magical artifacts), but she does not care, stating \"I must get them, because my mother wants them.\" Fate is not impressed by her young, naive rival, Nanoha, and tells her that her quest is worthless, but Nanoha's steadfast dedication to reforming Fate gets to her heart, and she begins to wane. However, this does not impress Fate's mother, Precia Testarossa, who tortures the girl just for not getting all the Jewel Seeds. Fate remains loyal despite Arf's protests; she remembers a time when Precia was kind and stable, and thinks that the Jewel Seeds will cure her mother's insanity. Fate teleports to her home from the top of an office building with complicated coordinates and a bit of magic. She lives in a gloomy hideout in the Garden of Time with her mother and Arf, sharing a room with the latter. She appears in the city whenever she senses a Jewel Seed, as she has no school and nothing else to do. This is also the reason why she spends much of the series transformed.   ~!Late in the series, Arf finally strikes out at Precia, and is thrown out as \"useless\". Fate finally starts to question her mother's motives, as Arf has always been there for her, but still refuses to join Nanoha and accepts her challenge to a winner-takes-all battle for the Jewel Seeds. When Fate loses, Precia appears and steals the Jewel Seeds. Fate tentatively joins up with the Time-Space Administration Bureau, and it is revealed that her memories of the past were copied, and that she is a clone of Precia's biological daughter, Alicia Testarossa. Fate doesn't take this news too well, but attempts to convince Precia to give up; the madwoman laughs in her face, states that the Jewel Seed collection was an attempt to reach the legendary Al Hazard and resurrect Alicia, and snaps that ever since Fate's creation, Precia has despised her. Fate, still hurt, attempts to save Precia, but is rejected as Precia and the preserved body of Alicia fall into a dimensional rift. Fate accepts Nanoha as a partner and a friend, and though she is arrested for what she did for Precia, promises to come back as she will probably be acquitted of all charges.  In A's, Fate and Arf join the Time-Space Administration Bureau and go to Earth to team up with Nanoha again. Their new mission is to prevent the Wolkenritter from stealing mages' Linker Cores (power source) for their Book of Darkness. Nanoha introduces Fate to her friends as a transfer student, and Fate has to get used to civilian life, cell phones and having a new mother figure in Lindy Haraoun. Early on in the season, Bardiche is upgraded to be able to compete with the Wolkenritter's weapons, and is renamed \"Bardiche Assault\". Nanoha and Fate meet a sickly girl, Hayate, whom both they and the Wolkenritter wish to save. At this point, Suzuka and Alisa discover Nanoha's true identity. Fate is captured by the Book of Darkness and thrown into a dream from which she will never want to wake; a happy life with older sister Alicia and a sane, kind Precia. However, Fate remembers that her friends need her, and says a sad goodbye to the life she always wanted in favour of the life she has. With the help of the Wolkenritter and Hayate herself, they cure both Hayate and the Book of Darkness, which transforms into Reinforce, Hayate's partner and weapon.  In an epilogue taking place six years later, Fate is older, has been adopted by Lindy, and working for the TSAB along with Nanoha and Hayate. She has changed her name to Fate T. Harlaown, the T presumably an abbreviation for Testarossa.  In StrikerS, Fate is a 19-year-old commissioned officer of the TSAB. She lives on Earth in Uminari City with Lindy, who has retired from her position as Admiral, having had too much excitement and seeking a desk job. Fate goes to school with Nanoha, Hayate, Suzuka, and Alisa. Though early promotional material suggested that she would abandon her battle uniform for a TSAB suit, a recent update of the nanoha.com website showed her in her Barrier Jacket, which appears to have grown to continue to fit her. She also seems to have gained a white cape, according to two promotional pictures; what the cape is for is unknown. In the manga, both the TSAB uniform and the Barrier Jacket are used with the Barrier Jacket overlaying or replacing the uniform when activated for combat situations.

He had no parents, so was raised by his entire tribe, the Scrya, from which he took his surname. He also obtained or created the intelligent device Raising Heart around this time, but his talents lay as a support mage, and so his attack abilities were low and he never made the device into a weapon.  Y\u016bno first appears running from a gigantic monster in the woods and attempting to seal the Jewel Seed inside it with Raising Heart. He fails, letting the monster get away, and collapses wounded on the ground. Y\u016bno uses his remaining power to call out to the nearest magic user and turns into a ferret. His call was heard in Nanoha Takamachi's dream, and later that day, she found the ferret in the woods and took him to the veterinary hospital. He quickly recovered, taking a liking to Nanoha and recognizing her as a possessor of the magical aptitude, a rarity on Earth. Later that night, he calls out to Nanoha again and she leaves the house and finds the Y\u016bno-ferret cornered by the same monster. He entrusts her with his weapon, Raising Heart, and seeing her raw power when she activated it, deduces that she can create magical armour and turn Raising Heart into a weapon of her design. She does so and begins her journey to seal away Jewel Seeds.  It turns out that Y\u016bno discovered the Seeds on an excavation, but officials of the Time-Space Administration Bureau lost them on Earth. Though Y\u016bno searches for the Seeds while Nanoha is busy, and though he fears that she is too inexperienced, he quickly recognizes that she is more powerful than anyone he has ever seen. When Fate arrives on the scene, Y\u016bno begins to fight Fate's familiar Arf while Nanoha is busy with her rival. This is the first time that Y\u016bno is referred to as Nanoha's familiar, but Nanoha replies with \"We're friends,\" a line later echoed in the first episode of A's, under different circumstances. This whole time, Nanoha is unaware that Y\u016bno is a human male, leading to a running gag of some embarrassing situations with girls changing and especially during the onsen episode, and every time he panics and looks away. In episode 8, though, Y\u016bno reveals his identity to Nanoha. Once Lindy Harlaown and her crew arrive to deal with the situation, Y\u016bno convinces her to allow him and Nanoha to continue their retrieval mission and is let off with a slap on the wrist when he ignores orders and allows Nanoha to help Fate seal six Jewel Seeds at once.  At the end, he, Nanoha, Chrono, Arf and finally Fate team up to defeat the real enemy, the adamantly insane Precia Testarossa. Y\u016bno cannot return to his own world for at least 6 months due to the aftereffects of the collapse of the Garden of Time, so he remains as Nanoha's pet. However, just before the start of A's, he returns to work with the TSAB and help with the trial of Fate and Arf.  Y\u016bno finishes up helping Fate with her trial, and he still does not get along with Chrono, due to their rivalry over Nanoha. When news comes that the most sought-after Lost Logia, the Book of Darkness has surfaced, the Asura mobilizes to retrieve it, and once Y\u016bno and company learn that it is in Uminari City, they take the assignment right away, Fighting off the Wolkenritter, who take the Linker Cores (magical power sources) of unsuspecting mages to complete the Book, Y\u016bno becomes more and more useful in both forms as a backup and overall white mage; his counterpart in the opposition is Shamal. Y\u016bno also resumes his civilian life as Nanoha's pet, and is subsequently showered with attention by Nanoha's friends and family. Unlike in Nanoha, humor in A's at his expense is less common, save for deadpan jokes from Chrono[2] and a gag scene where Nanoha dreams of eating baked sweet potatoes but instead bites Y\u016bno in her sleep[3].  In the epilogue which takes place six years later, Y\u016bno continues to work for the TSAB as chief librarian of the Infinity Library, now wears glasses, and is confirmed to support Nanoha and Fate's relationship from the distance.  Y\u016bno returns in episode 7 of StrikerS during an auction of several Relics at a hotel. Due to his position as chief librarian of the Infinity Library as well as his experience as an Archeologist, he was called to speak at the auction for his expertise on Magic Relics. Later (in episode 8) he has a happy reunion with Nanoha, their relationship still shown as a strong one. He does not seem to have much of a larger role or many apperances in this final installment of the trilogy until the very end, where he makes an appearance in the Infinity Library."}}, {"role": "SUPPORTING", "voiceActors": [{"id": 95348, "name": {"first": "Ryouko", "last": "Shiraishi"}}, {"id": 102994, "name": {"first": "Miley", "last": "Yamamoto"}}], "node": {"id": 9625, "name": {"first": "Miyuki", "middle": null, "last": "Takamachi", "full": "Miyuki Takamachi", "native": "\u9ad8\u753a \u7f8e\u7531\u5e0c", "alternative": []}, "description": " __Triangle Heart:__  Miyuki is actually the cousin of Kyouya and Nanoha, but is raised by their family and she considers them siblings.

While a researcher of familiars, she does not have one of her own during Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, and her weapon is unnamed.  Precia first appears in episode 7, having previously been mentioned as the reason that Fate is gathering Jewel Seeds. She is abusive and cruel, torturing Fate simply for not getting enough Jewel Seeds and not disposing of potential hindrance Nanoha. Though Arf hates Precia and tells Fate that she is not worth it, Fate asserts that she remembers a time when Precia was kind and stable, and thinks that she will be cured of her insanity if she gets the Jewel Seeds.  Precia lives in a gloomy hideout in the Garden of Time with Fate and Arf, although the latter two generally \"live\" in their apartment in Uminari City more than the hideout itself. Precia spends the entirety of the series in the Garden of Time, and always transformed, except in flashbacks. She used to be a scientist involved in many areas of research, including the creation of familiars, but had another secret, forbidden project.   ~!Late in the series, Arf finally strikes out at Precia, and is thrown out as \"useless\". Precia supervises Fate's winner-takes-all fight with Nanoha, and when Fate loses, sends a storm to attack Fate and steal her Jewel Seeds before she can give them away. The Time-Space Administration Bureau, having joined up with Nanoha and labeled Precia as a dangerous criminal, traces her to the Garden of Time and attempts to capture her. Precia defeats their first group of soldiers and, realizing that Fate is among those observing her in the Arthra, reveals that Fate is a clone of her biological daughter Alicia. Precia went insane when Alicia died and concentrated herself on her secret project, which researched both cloning and the forbidden art of resurrection: Project Fate, from which Fate Testarossa takes her name. She also reveals that Fate was a temporary replacement, a tool to get the Jewel Seeds so that Precia could go to the ancient capital of the magical worlds, Al Hazard, and retrieve the lost technology that could finish her work.  Precia activates the nine Jewel Seeds in her possession and wishes to go to Al Hazard. This action causes a massive dimensional disturbance, and the Garden of Time begins to fall apart. When Fate joins up with Nanoha and the TSAB forces, she attempts to save Precia, but the crazed mage refuses, laughing in her face and choosing to die with the preserved body of Alicia rather than face a several-hundred-year sentence for her crimes. In the end, she falls without a struggle into a dimensional void.!~ (wikipedia)   ~!In the movie it was revealed that Precia was always busy with work and never had time for her daughter.  She had promised that the two of them would spend time together before Alicia started school.  But durring an experiment Alicia died driving her mother mad with guilt.

It is soon apparent that even Fate does not know why she is looking for these specimens of Lost Logia (the series' term for ancient magical artifacts), but she does not care, stating \"I must get them, because my mother wants them.\" Fate is not impressed by her young, naive rival, Nanoha, and tells her that her quest is worthless, but Nanoha's steadfast dedication to reforming Fate gets to her heart, and she begins to wane. However, this does not impress Fate's mother, Precia Testarossa, who tortures the girl just for not getting all the Jewel Seeds. Fate remains loyal despite Arf's protests; she remembers a time when Precia was kind and stable, and thinks that the Jewel Seeds will cure her mother's insanity. Fate teleports to her home from the top of an office building with complicated coordinates and a bit of magic. She lives in a gloomy hideout in the Garden of Time with her mother and Arf, sharing a room with the latter. She appears in the city whenever she senses a Jewel Seed, as she has no school and nothing else to do. This is also the reason why she spends much of the series transformed.   ~!Late in the series, Arf finally strikes out at Precia, and is thrown out as \"useless\". Fate finally starts to question her mother's motives, as Arf has always been there for her, but still refuses to join Nanoha and accepts her challenge to a winner-takes-all battle for the Jewel Seeds. When Fate loses, Precia appears and steals the Jewel Seeds. Fate tentatively joins up with the Time-Space Administration Bureau, and it is revealed that her memories of the past were copied, and that she is a clone of Precia's biological daughter, Alicia Testarossa. Fate doesn't take this news too well, but attempts to convince Precia to give up; the madwoman laughs in her face, states that the Jewel Seed collection was an attempt to reach the legendary Al Hazard and resurrect Alicia, and snaps that ever since Fate's creation, Precia has despised her. Fate, still hurt, attempts to save Precia, but is rejected as Precia and the preserved body of Alicia fall into a dimensional rift. Fate accepts Nanoha as a partner and a friend, and though she is arrested for what she did for Precia, promises to come back as she will probably be acquitted of all charges.  In A's, Fate and Arf join the Time-Space Administration Bureau and go to Earth to team up with Nanoha again. Their new mission is to prevent the Wolkenritter from stealing mages' Linker Cores (power source) for their Book of Darkness. Nanoha introduces Fate to her friends as a transfer student, and Fate has to get used to civilian life, cell phones and having a new mother figure in Lindy Haraoun. Early on in the season, Bardiche is upgraded to be able to compete with the Wolkenritter's weapons, and is renamed \"Bardiche Assault\". Nanoha and Fate meet a sickly girl, Hayate, whom both they and the Wolkenritter wish to save. At this point, Suzuka and Alisa discover Nanoha's true identity. Fate is captured by the Book of Darkness and thrown into a dream from which she will never want to wake; a happy life with older sister Alicia and a sane, kind Precia. However, Fate remembers that her friends need her, and says a sad goodbye to the life she always wanted in favour of the life she has. With the help of the Wolkenritter and Hayate herself, they cure both Hayate and the Book of Darkness, which transforms into Reinforce, Hayate's partner and weapon.  In an epilogue taking place six years later, Fate is older, has been adopted by Lindy, and working for the TSAB along with Nanoha and Hayate. She has changed her name to Fate T. Harlaown, the T presumably an abbreviation for Testarossa.  In StrikerS, Fate is a 19-year-old commissioned officer of the TSAB.

Fate goes to school with Nanoha, Hayate, Suzuka, and Alisa. Though early promotional material suggested that she would abandon her battle uniform for a TSAB suit, a recent update of the nanoha.com website showed her in her Barrier Jacket, which appears to have grown to continue to fit her. She also seems to have gained a white cape, according to two promotional pictures; what the cape is for is unknown.

The battle ends with Shamal finally managing to get Nanoha's Linker Core and Nanoha breaking Vita's barrier.   ~! Vita fights for the sake of protecting their mistress, Hayate, whom she is completely dedicated to and possibly (in the manga, certainly) in love with. The Wolkenritter attack mages to steal their Linker Cores, their sources of magic, to fill the 666 pages of the Book of Darkness with this power before it saps any more of Hayate's and she becomes fully paralyzed. They continue to obtain Linker Cores and fight off interference from the Time-Space Administration Bureau (TSAB), mainly Fate and Nanoha- whose name Vita purposely gets wrong to annoy her- while they try to keep Hayate from knowing that they are stealing magic for pages; she has told them that as long as she is mistress of the Book, she will not allow anyone to be harmed over it.  The Wolkenritter, especially Vita, are determined to save Hayate even if it means going against her wishes. What the Wolkenritter don't know about Hayate is that the Book of Darkness, once completed, may stop sapping her Linker Core for pages, but that does not mean that it will stop hurting her or undo its damage. In fact, the master of the Book dies upon its completion. Vita is the first to recognize that something may be wrong with what they are doing and that they have forgotten something very important, but her devotion to Hayate keeps her fighting for Linker Cores regardless. Just before the Book of Darkness is completed, Suzuka brings Nanoha, Arisa, and Fate to visit Hayate in the hospital while the Wolkenritter are there. The warring groups recognize each other and their shared wish at once, and meet on the roof of the hospital. Nanoha and Fate try to tell the Wolkenritter about what will happen to Hayate, but their confrontation is cut short by both the interference of two masked men and the completion of the Book of Darkness with the Linker Cores of the Wolkenritter themselves.  The masked men are actually women, Alia and Lotte Liese, who frame Nanoha and Fate for the death of Vita and the others. Hayate screams in horror for all of this to stop and is taken over by the will of the Book of Darkness, becoming the fearsome, possessed woman inside of it just as the real duo escapes their prison. Meanwhile, Vita's spirit is trapped inside the Book of Darkness with the others. When Hayate rejects her own wish of vengeance, she reprograms the entire Book, but a virus still remains inside, the one that caused the evil aspect of the Book in the first place. Hayate awakens the spirit of Vita and her friends inside the book of Darkness, and she decides to join the fight against the automated defence program that Hayate describes as \"the 'darkness' in the Book of Darkness.\" Vita finally recognizes Nanoha as an equal, though she won't admit it, and calls her by her real name.  In an epilogue taking place six years later, Vita has not aged, considering her nature as a computer program, and still lives with the other Wolkenritter and Hayate, posing as a relative.!~   __Vita in Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS__  Four years after the A's epilogue, Second Lieutenant Vita is sub-commander of the Stars Squad in the TSAB, working directly under Nanoha, who, in turn, obeys Hayate. She and the other Wolkenritter were kept close to Hayate and each other-- Shamal and Zafira are support, Signum is with the Lightning Squad-- because they work most effectively as a team.

He had no parents, so was raised by his entire tribe, the Scrya, from which he took his surname. He also obtained or created the intelligent device Raising Heart around this time, but his talents lay as a support mage, and so his attack abilities were low and he never made the device into a weapon.  Y\u016bno first appears running from a gigantic monster in the woods and attempting to seal the Jewel Seed inside it with Raising Heart. He fails, letting the monster get away, and collapses wounded on the ground. Y\u016bno uses his remaining power to call out to the nearest magic user and turns into a ferret. His call was heard in Nanoha Takamachi's dream, and later that day, she found the ferret in the woods and took him to the veterinary hospital. He quickly recovered, taking a liking to Nanoha and recognizing her as a possessor of the magical aptitude, a rarity on Earth. Later that night, he calls out to Nanoha again and she leaves the house and finds the Y\u016bno-ferret cornered by the same monster. He entrusts her with his weapon, Raising Heart, and seeing her raw power when she activated it, deduces that she can create magical armour and turn Raising Heart into a weapon of her design. She does so and begins her journey to seal away Jewel Seeds.  It turns out that Y\u016bno discovered the Seeds on an excavation, but officials of the Time-Space Administration Bureau lost them on Earth. Though Y\u016bno searches for the Seeds while Nanoha is busy, and though he fears that she is too inexperienced, he quickly recognizes that she is more powerful than anyone he has ever seen. When Fate arrives on the scene, Y\u016bno begins to fight Fate's familiar Arf while Nanoha is busy with her rival. This is the first time that Y\u016bno is referred to as Nanoha's familiar, but Nanoha replies with \"We're friends,\" a line later echoed in the first episode of A's, under different circumstances. This whole time, Nanoha is unaware that Y\u016bno is a human male, leading to a running gag of some embarrassing situations with girls changing and especially during the onsen episode, and every time he panics and looks away. In episode 8, though, Y\u016bno reveals his identity to Nanoha. Once Lindy Harlaown and her crew arrive to deal with the situation, Y\u016bno convinces her to allow him and Nanoha to continue their retrieval mission and is let off with a slap on the wrist when he ignores orders and allows Nanoha to help Fate seal six Jewel Seeds at once.  At the end, he, Nanoha, Chrono, Arf and finally Fate team up to defeat the real enemy, the adamantly insane Precia Testarossa. Y\u016bno cannot return to his own world for at least 6 months due to the aftereffects of the collapse of the Garden of Time, so he remains as Nanoha's pet. However, just before the start of A's, he returns to work with the TSAB and help with the trial of Fate and Arf.  Y\u016bno finishes up helping Fate with her trial, and he still does not get along with Chrono, due to their rivalry over Nanoha. When news comes that the most sought-after Lost Logia, the Book of Darkness has surfaced, the Asura mobilizes to retrieve it, and once Y\u016bno and company learn that it is in Uminari City, they take the assignment right away, Fighting off the Wolkenritter, who take the Linker Cores (magical power sources) of unsuspecting mages to complete the Book, Y\u016bno becomes more and more useful in both forms as a backup and overall white mage; his counterpart in the opposition is Shamal. Y\u016bno also resumes his civilian life as Nanoha's pet, and is subsequently showered with attention by Nanoha's friends and family. Unlike in Nanoha, humor in A's at his expense is less common, save for deadpan jokes from Chrono[2] and a gag scene where Nanoha dreams of eating baked sweet potatoes but instead bites Y\u016bno in her sleep[3].  In the epilogue which takes place six years later, Y\u016bno continues to work for the TSAB as chief librarian of the Infinity Library, now wears glasses, and is confirmed to support Nanoha and Fate's relationship from the distance.  Y\u016bno returns in episode 7 of StrikerS during an auction of several Relics at a hotel. Due to his position as chief librarian of the Infinity Library as well as his experience as an Archeologist, he was called to speak at the auction for his expertise on Magic Relics. Later (in episode 8) he has a happy reunion with Nanoha, their relationship still shown as a strong one.

The Wolkenritter overpower the TSAB troupe with their use of high-powered magical cartridges, and Signum manages to snap Fate's staff, Bardiche, in half. The battle ends with Shamal finally managing to get Nanoha's Linker Core and Nanoha breaking Vita's barrier. Signum refuses to take a bath that night for fear of Hayate seeing the injuries sustained in her battle with Fate.

Unlike Vita, however, she did not participate in training the trainees, under the pretense that she is an old fashioned knight and can only teach to them is to get close to their enemies and rip them apart. However, near the end half of the series, she accepted the request of Erio Mondial to spar with him.  During the attack of Saint's Cradle, Signum fought with Knight Zest Grangeitz, who united with Agito. She performed unison with Reinforce Zwei, but only managed to end the fight with a draw. The fight continues inside the headquarters of Capital City Defense Forces, and Signum came out victorious. In his dying breath, Zest asks her to take care of Agito and Lutecia Alpino.

With regards to Kaede, he thinks of her as a childhood friend only.

Despite her youth, Haman's charisma, guile, and remarkable Newtype abilities enabled her to rally the Axis refugees for their triumphant return to the Earth Sphere. While nominally just a regent to the child heir Mineva Zabi, Haman is in truth the unchallenged master of the Axis forces, who seeks to restore the Zabi dynasty in order to seize power for herself.    ~!It is important to note however that Haman was not always the way she was in Zeta Gundam and Gundam ZZ. The manga Char's Deleted Affair and its mini prequel Haman's Deleted Affair, reveal that Haman had a sweet disposition as a young teenager. The latter manga reveals that Haman grew up in Axis after the One Year War, never having seen the Earth, and had to endure a hard life growing up as Axis was not well suited to support life, and it was not any better with the looming threat of the Federation possibly attacking them. The former manga also shows she was a romantic of sorts, as she became romantically involved with Zeon's Red Comet, Char Aznable. Though CDA also reaffirms what was said in HDA, as Haman had to train to be a soldier and possibly felt obligated to protect the people on Axis, viewing their treatment by the Federation as unjust. Thus Haman's personality in the anime is a result of her troubled upbringing, never having had the chance to be a child and enjoy life, Haman became dark, cold, and isolated from the rest of the world, which she states in Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ, is what made her stronger and is her strength.!~  Source-Gundam Wiki"}}, {"role": "SUPPORTING", "voiceActors": [{"id": 95488, "name": {"first": "Masami", "last": "Kikuchi"}}], "node": {"id": 68241, "name": {"first": "Iino", "middle": null, "last": "Abbav", "full": "Iino Abbav", "native": "\u30a4\u30fc\u30ce\u30fb\u30a2\u30c3\u30d0\u30fc\u30d6", "alternative": []}, "description": "Iino Abbav is one of  Judau Ashta's friends from Side 1 colony Shangri La.

His troops capture Heero, Quatre, the Gundam scientists and soldiers of the Treize Faction. He had the former test out the system, determining that it can fight even more efficiently thank a mobile doll. Unfortunately, Heero took control of the Gundam and went berserk, trying to kill anyone trying to kill him. Eventually, it was abandoned and Clark attempted to pick up the pieces. He continued to use the Gundam to record results but the complexities make it hard for him after prolonged periods of use. After it is discovered that he used numerous mobile dolls to gather data on the system's capabilities, Tubarov sends a number of soldiers to discover his whereabouts. During the same time, Trant tracks down Gundam pilot Duo Maxwell and forces him to battle the mobile dolls in order to gather more accurate data. Duo becomes overwhelmed by the ZERO System and is pulled out of the cockpit by Trant as OZ soldiers arrive to retrieve Trant and destroy Wing Zero. Trant immediately pilots Wing Zero and easily dispatches the soldiers and their accompanying mobile dolls. However, the ZERO System overwhelms his mental state, making him crave more destruction. Duo, now piloting his Deathscythe Hell, prevents Trant from destroying a nearby colony and eventually kills him in battle.  http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Trant_Clark"}}, {"role": "SUPPORTING",

Prior to Operation Meteor, Duo was part of the spacegoing salvage organization known as the Sweeper Group, and on Earth he is assisted by the Sweepers' seafaring kinsfolk.

However, the Space Revolutionary forces played their trump card and dropped hundreds of space colonies onto the Earth, plunging the planet into a seven-year-long nuclear winter. The Federation collapsed, but the Space Revolutionary Army was unable to invade the Earth in the aftermath of the colony drop. Fifteen years have passed. The year is now After War 0015, and a New Federation has sprung up on Earth to restore order. In space, the colonial leaders have been rebuilding their own forces as well. By chance, fifteen-year-old Garrod Ran has discovered an old Federation mobile suit, the Gundam X, and now he uses it to help out the Vulture ship Freeden in its struggle to keep the powers that be from repeating the mistakes of the past.

There are doubts on whether she is the true ruler - doubts which prove correct when the true ruler of Windbloom is discovered by Sergay W&aacute;ng. Mikoto the cat is her pet. She has a love-hate relationship with Nagi, leaning more towards the &#039;hate&#039; end of the spectrum.

Arika, who was raised in the country, was completely clueless as to Mashiro&#039;s arrogant attitude toward her, even when she showed them that she was the princess in which Nina apologized for their ignorance.    As time passed, Mashiro pushed the people around her harder and harder. She would repeatedly shirk her responsibilities as queen in order to visit Garderobe and laugh at Arika&#039;s clumsy attempts at Otome training.

As Sergay W&aacute;ng noted, the city was suffering from increasing unemployment. Small glimpses of her past revealed that when Mashiro was young, she was completely spoiled as a child, being given virtually anything she wanted on demand. When she overheard some of the rumors that she was not the true princess, Mashiro&#039;s behavior worsened due to her highly increased feelings of insecurity and inadequacy.    During an emergency, she formed a contract with Arika to save their lives. Unfortunately for the two, the search for ways to break the contract yielded no answers.

Later, Yukito, Misuzu and Hijiri find a letter from Kano saying she overheard the whole thing and that she&rsquo;s going to fly away.  They go to search for her and find her at the shrine again. This time, her scarf has been taken off and there is blood around her wrist with no visible wound. A feather then begins to glow on the shrine and Yukito gives it to Kano, invoking a hallucination where Kano sees her Mother. During this hallucination, Kano thanks her mother for giving birth to her and tells her she no longer needs the scarf. When Kano comes back, she tells everyone she saw her mother and that she is alright now. Kano then lets the scarf fly away into the wind.!~"}}, {"role": "SUPPORTING", "voiceActors": [{"id": 95607, "name": {"first": "Kelly", "last": "Manison"}}, {"id": 96446, "name": {"first": "Yuriko", "last": "Yamamoto"}}, {"id": 110135, "name": {"first": "Do Yeong", "last": "Song"}}], "node": {"id": 46961, "name": {"first": "", "middle": null, "last": "Minagi no Haha", "full": "Minagi no Haha", "native": "\u7f8e\u51ea\u306e\u6bcd", "alternative": ["Minagi's Mother"]}, "description": null}}, {"role": "SUPPORTING", "voiceActors": [{"id": 95760, "name": {"first": "Keiko", "last": "Han"}}, {"id": 108355, "name": {"first": "Robin", "last": "Terry"}}, {"id": 109995, "name": {"first": "Hye Ok", "last": "Jeong"}}], "node": {"id": 46959, "name": {"first": "Yaobikuni", "middle": null, "last": null, "full": "Yaobikuni", "native": "\u516b\u767e\u6bd4\u4e18\u5c3c", "alternative": []}, "description": "Not much is known about Yao Bikuni, except that she was imprisoned deep in the mountains and had a winged child, named Kanna.

magical girl (Mah&#333; Sh&#333;jo) named Chacha. Living with her guardian in a cottage on Mochi-mochi mountain is Seravi, who is her teacher and also the fictional world's greatest magician. Chacha is clumsy in casting her spells because, throughout the anime, when she summons something, it often turns out to be something that she didn't mean to cast, for example, spiders (kumo) instead of a cloud (also kumo). At times in the anime when she and her friends are in trouble, however, her spells do work. Living on the same mountain is a boy gifted with enormous strength named Riiya. It is described that Riiya came from a family of werewolves who can instantly change into a wolf whenever they want. Quite far from Mochi-mochi mountain lies Urizuri mountain. Dorothy, also a well known magician in her land, lives in a castle on Urizuri mountain. Living with her is Shiine, her student. Shiine is adept when it comes to casting spells. He is a young wizard and most of his knowledge about magic was taught to him by Dorothy.<br><br>\nThe first 2 seasons were originally created by the anime team.
